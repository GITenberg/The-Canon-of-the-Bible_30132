<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The substance of the present work was written toward the
close of the year 1875 for the new edition of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Encyclopaedia
Britannica</span></span>. Having been abridged and mutilated, contrary to
the author's wishes, before its publication there, he resolved to
print it entire. With that view it has undergone repeated revision
with enlargement in different parts, and been made as
complete as the limits of an essay appeared to allow. As nothing
of importance has been knowingly omitted, the writer hopes
it will be found a comprehensive summary of all that concerns
the formation and history of the Bible canon. The place occupied
by it was vacant. No English book reflecting the processes
of results of recent criticism, gives an account of the
canon in both Testaments. Articles and essays upon the subject
there are; but their standpoint is usually apologetic not scientific,
traditional rather than impartial, unreasonably conservative
without being critical. The topic is weighty, involving the consideration
of great questions, such as the inspiration, authenticity,
authority, and age of the Scriptures. The author has tried
to handle it fairly, founding his statements on such evidence as
seemed convincing, and condensing them into a moderate compass.
If the reader wishes to know the evidence, he may find it
in the writer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introductions to the Old and New Testaments</span></span>,
where the separate books of Scripture are discussed; and in the
late treatises of other critics. While his expositions are capable
of expansion, it is believed that they will not be easily shaken.
He commends the work to the attention of all who have an interest
in the progress of theology, and are seeking a foundation
for their faith less precarious than books however venerable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has not been the writer's purpose to chronicle phases of
opinion, or to refute what he believes to be error in the newest
hypotheses about the age, authority, and composition of the
books. His aim has been rather to set forth the most correct
view of the questions involved in a history of the canon, whether
it be more or less recent. Some may think that the latest or
most current account of such questions is the best; but that is
not his opinion. Hence, the fashionable belief that much of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pentateuch, the Book of Leviticus wholly, with large parts of
Exodus and Numbers, in a word, that all the laws relating to
divine worship, with most of the chronological tables or statistics,
belong to Ezra, who is metamorphosed in fact into the first
Elohist, is unnoticed. Hence, also, the earliest gospel is not
declared to be Mark's. Neither has the author ventured to place
the fourth gospel at the end of the first century, as Ewald and
Weitzsäcker do, after the manner of the old critics; or with
Keim so early as 110-115 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many evince a restless anxiety to find something novel; and
to depart from well-established conclusions for the sake of originality.
This shows a morbid state of mind. Amid the feverish
outlook for discoveries and the slight regard for what is safe,
conservatism is a commendable thing. Some again desire to return,
as far as they can, to orthodoxy, finding between that extreme
and rationalism a middle way which offers a resting-place
to faith. The numerous changes which criticism presents are
not a symptom of soundness. The writer is far indeed from
thinking that every question connected with the books of Scripture
is finally settled; but the majority undoubtedly are, though
several already fixed by great scholars continue to be opened up
afresh. He does not profess to adopt the phase of criticism
which is fashionable at the moment; it is enough to state what
approves itself to his judgment, and to hold it fast amid the contrarieties
of conjecture or the cravings of curiosity. Present
excrescences or aberrations of belief will have their day and
disappear. Large portions of the Pentateuch will cease to be
consigned to a post-exile time, and the gospels of Matthew and
Luke will again be counted the chief sources of Mark's. It will
also be acknowledged that the first as it now exists, is of much
later origin than the fall of Jerusalem. Nor will there be so
great anxiety to show that Justin Martyr was acquainted with
the fourth gospel, and owed his Logos-doctrine chiefly to it.
The difference of ten or twenty years in the date of a gospel will
not be considered of essential importance in estimating its
character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present edition has been revised throughout and several
parts re-written. The author hopes that it will be found still
more worthy of the favor with which the first was received.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As introductory to the following dissertation, I shall explain
and define certain terms that frequently occur
in it, especially <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">canon</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">apocryphal</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiastical</span></span>, and the like.
A right apprehension of these will make the observations
advanced respecting the canon and its formation plainer.
The words have not been taken in the same sense by all, a
fact that obscures their sense. They have been employed
more or less vaguely by different writers. Varying ideas
have been attached to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Greek original of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">canon</span></span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
means primarily a straight
rod or pole; and metaphorically, what serves to keep a
thing upright or straight, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rule</span></span>. In the New Testament it
occurs in Gal. vi. 16 and 2 Cor. x. 13, 15, 16, signifying in
the former, a measure; in the latter, what is measured, a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">district</span></span>. But we have now to do with its ecclesiastical use.
There are three opinions as to the origin of its application
to the writings used by the church. According to Toland,
Whiston, Semler, Baur, and others, the word had originally
the sense of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">list</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">catalogue</span></span> of books publicly read in
Christian assemblies. Others, as Steiner, suppose that since
the Alexandrian grammarians applied it to collections of
Old Greek authors as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">models</span></span>
of excellence or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">classics</span></span>, it
meant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">classical</span></span> (canonical)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">writings</span></span>. According to a third
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opinion, the term included from the first the idea of a regulating
principle. This is the more probable, because the
same idea lies in the New Testament use of the noun, and
pervades its applications in the language of the early
Fathers down to the time of Constantine, as Credner has
shown.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The <span class="tei tei-q">“canon of the church”</span> in the Clementine

of Origen,<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
imply a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">normative principle</span></em>. But
we cannot assent to Credner's view of the Greek word for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">canon</span></span>
being an abbreviation of <span class="tei tei-q">“Scriptures of canon,”</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> equivalent to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripturæ legis</span></span> in Diocletian's
Act<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>—a view too
artificial, and unsanctioned by usage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">canon</span></span> was employed by Greek
writers in the sense of a mere <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">list</span></span>; but when it was transferred
to the Scripture books, it included the idea of a regulative
and normal power—a list of books forming a rule or
law, because the newly-formed Catholic Church required a
standard of appeal in opposition to the Gnostics with their
arbitrary use of sacred writings. There is a lack of evidence
on behalf of its use before the books of the New Testament
had been paralleled with those of the Old in authority and
inspiration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest example of its application to a catalogue of
the Old or New Testament books occurs in the Latin translation
of Origen's homily on Joshua, where the original

till towards the close of the second century when the conception
of a Catholic Church was realized. The latter collection
was not called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></span>, or put on a par with the
Old Testament as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inspired</span></span>, till

To Its Close.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first important part of the Old Testament put together
as a whole was the Pentateuch, or rather, the
five books of Moses and Joshua. This was preceded by
smaller documents, which one or more redactors embodied in
it. The earliest things committed to writing were probably
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the ten words</span></span> proceeding from Moses himself, afterwards enlarged
into the ten commandments which exist at present
in two recensions (Exod. xx., Deut. v.) It is true that we
have the oldest form of the decalogue from the Jehovist not
the Elohist; but that is no valid objection against the antiquity
of the nucleus, out of which it arose. It is also
probable that several legal and ceremonial enactments belong,
if not to Moses himself, at least to his time; as also
the Elohistic list of stations in Numbers xxxiii. To the
same time belongs the song of Miriam in Exodus xv.,
probably consisting of a few lines at first, and subsequently
enlarged; with a triumphal ode over the fall of Heshbon
(Numbers xxi. 27-30). The little poetical piece in Numbers
xxi. 17, 18, afterwards misunderstood and so taken literally,
is post-Mosaic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the unsettled times of Joshua and the Judges there
could have been comparatively little writing. The song of
Deborah appeared, full of poetic force and fire. The period
of the early kings was characterized not only by a remarkable
development of the Hebrew people and their consolidation
into a national state, but by fresh literary activity.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Laws were written out for the guidance of priests and
people; and the political organization of the rapidly growing
nation was promoted by poetical productions in which
spiritual life expressed its aspirations. Schools of prophets
were instituted by Samuel, whose literary efforts tended to
purify the worship. David was an accomplished poet,
whose psalms are composed in lofty strains; and Solomon
may have written a few odes. The building of the temple,
and the arrangements connected with its worship, contributed
materially to a written legislation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this early and flourishing period appeared the book
of the Wars of Jehovah,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>

Above all, the Elohists now appeared, the first
of whom, in the reign of Saul, was author of annals, beginning
at the earliest time which were distinguished by genealogical
and chronological details as well as systematic
minuteness, by archaic simplicity, and by legal prescriptions
more theoretical than practical. The long genealogical
registers with an artificial chronology and a statement of
the years of men's lives, the dry narratives, the precise accounts
of the gradual enlargement of divine laws, the copious
description of the tabernacle and the institution of divine
worship, are wearisome, though pervaded by a theoretic interest
which looks at everything from a legal point of view.
A second or junior Elohist was less methodical and more
fragmentary, supplying additional information, furnishing
new theocratic details, and setting forth the relation of Israel
to heathen nations and to God. In contrast with his predecessor,
he has great beauty of description, which is
exemplified in the account of Isaac's sacrifice and the history
of Joseph; in picturesque and graphic narratives interspersed
with few reflections. His parallels to the later writer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commonly called the Jehovist, are numerous. The third
author, who lived in the time of Uzziah, though more mythological
than the Elohists, was less formal. His stand-point
is prophetic. The third document incorporated with the Elohistic
ones formed an important part of the whole, exhibiting
a vividness which the first lacked; with descriptions of
persons and things from another stand-point. The Jehovist
belonged to the northern kingdom; the Elohists were of
Judah.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The state of the nation after Rehoboam was unfavorable
to literature. When the people were threatened and attacked
by other nations, divided among themselves in worship and
all higher interests, rent by conflicting parties, the theocratic
principle which was the true bond of union could not
assert itself with effect. The people were corrupt; their
religious life debased. The example of the kings was
usually prejudicial to political healthiness. Contact with
foreigners as well as with the older inhabitants of the land,
hindered progress. In these circumstances the prophets
were the true reformers, the advocates of political liberty,
expositors of the principles that give life and stability to a
nation. In Judah, Joel wrote prophetic discourses; in
Israel, Amos and Hosea. Now, too, a redactor put together
the Elohistic and Jehovistic documents, making various
changes in them, adding throughout sentences or words
that seemed desirable, and suppressing what was unsuited
to his taste. Several psalm-writers enriched the national
literature after David. Learned men at the court of Hezekiah
recast and enlarged (Proverbs xxv.-xxix.) the national
proverbs, which bore Solomon's name because the
nucleus of an older collection belonged to that monarch.
These literary courtiers were not prophets, but rather scribes.
The book of Job was written, with the exception of Elihu's
later discourses, which were not inserted in it till after the
return from Babylon; and Deuteronomy, with Joshua, was
added to the preceding collection in the reign of Manasseh.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The gifted author of Deuteronomy, who was evidently imbued
with the prophetic spirit, completed the Pentateuch,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the five books
of Moses and Joshua, revising the Elohist-Jehovistic
work, and making various additions and alterations.
He did the same thing to the historical books of
Judges, Samuel, and Kings; which received from him their
present form. Immediately before and during the exile
there were numerous authors and compilers. New psalms
appeared, more or less national in spirit. Ezekiel, Jeremiah
and others prophesied; especially an unknown seer who
described the present condition of the people, predicting
their coming glories and renovated worship in strains of far-reaching
import.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>
This great prophet expected the regeneration
of the nation from the pious portion of it, the
prophets in particular, not from a kingly Messiah as Isaiah
did; for the hopes resting on rulers out of David's house
had been disappointed. His aspirations turned to spiritual
means. He was not merely an enthusiastic seer with comprehensive
glance, but also a practical philosopher who set
forth the doctrine of the innocent suffering for the guilty;
differing therein from Ezekiel's theory of individual reward
and punishment in the present world—a theory out of harmony
with the circumstances of actual life. The very
misfortunes of the nation, and the signs of their return,
excited within the nobler spirits hopes of a brighter future,
in which the flourishing reign of David should be surpassed
by the universal worship of Jehovah. In consequence of
their outward condition, the prophets of the exile were
usually writers, like Ezekiel, not public speakers; and their
announcement of glad tidings could only be transmitted
privately from person to person. This explains in part the
oblivion into which their names fell; so that the author or
redactor of Jeremiah l., li.; the author of chapters xiii.-xiv.
23, xxi. 1-10, xxiv.-xxvii., xxxiv., xxxv., inserted in Isaiah;
and, above all, the Babylonian Isaiah, whom Hitzig improbably
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
identifies with the high-priest Joshua, are unknown.
After the return from Babylon the literary spirit manifested
itself in the prophets of the restoration—Haggai, Zechariah,
and Malachi—who wrote to recall their countrymen to a
sense of religious duties; though their ideas were borrowed
in part from older prophets of more original genius. The
book of Esther appeared, to make the observance of the
purim feast, which was of Persian origin, more general in
Palestine. The large historical work comprising the books
of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles, was compiled partly out
of materials written by Ezra and Nehemiah, partly out of
older historical records which formed a portion of the national
literature. Several temple-psalms were also composed;
a part of the present book of Proverbs; Ecclesiastes,
whose tone and language betray its late origin; and Jonah,
whose diction puts its date after the Babylonian captivity.
The Maccabean age called forth the book of Daniel and
various psalms. In addition to new productions there was
an inclination to collect former documents. To Zechariah's
authentic prophecies were added the earlier ones contained
in chapters ix.-xiv.; and the Psalms were gradually brought
together, being made up into divisions at different times;
the first and second divisions proceeding from one redactor,
the third from another, the fourth and fifth from a still
later. Various writings besides their own were grouped
around the names of earlier prophets, as was the case with
Isaiah and Jeremiah.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The literature is more indebted for its best constituents to
the prophetic than to the priestly order, because the prophets
were preachers of repentance and righteousness whose
great aim was to make Israel a Jehovah-worshipping nation
to the exclusion of other gods. Their utterances were
essentially ethical and religious; their pictures of the future
subjective and ideal. There was silently elaborated in their
schools a spiritual monotheism, over against the crude
polytheism of the people generally—a theocratic ideal inadequately
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apprehended by gross and sensuous Israel—Jehovism
simple and sublime amid a sacerdotal worship which
left the heart impure while cleansing the hands. Instead of
taking their stand upon the law, with its rules of worship,
its ceremonial precepts and penalties against transgressors,
the prophets set themselves above it, speaking slightingly
of the forms and customs which the people took for the
whole of religion. To the view of such as were prepared to
receive a faith that looked for its realization to the future,
they helped to create a millennium, in which the worship of
Jehovah alone should become the basis of a universal religion
for humanity. In addition to the prophetic literature
proper, they wrote historical works also. How superior
this literature is to the priestly, appears from a comparison
of the Kings and Chronicles. The subjective underlies the
one; the objective distinguishes the other. Faith in Jehovah,
clothed, it may be in sensible or historical forms,
characterizes the one; reference of an outward order to a
divine source, the other. The sanctity of a people under
the government of a righteous God, is the object of the one;
the sanctity of institutions, that of the other. Even when
the prophets wrote history, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the facts</span></em> are subordinate to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
belief</span></em>. Subjective purposes colored their representation
of real events.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To them we are indebted for the Messianic idea, the hope
of a better time in which their high ideal of the theocracy
should be realized. With such belief in the future, with
pious aspirations enlivening their patriotism, did they comfort
and encourage their countrymen. The hope, general
or indefinite at first, was afterwards attached to the house of
David, out of which a restorer of the theocracy was expected,
a king pre-eminent in righteousness, and marvelously
gifted. It was not merely a political but a religious hope,
implying the thorough purification of the nation, the extinction
of idolatry, the general spread and triumph of true
religion. The pious wishes of the prophets, often repeated,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
became a sort of doctrine, and contributed to sustain the
failing spirit of the people. The indefinite idea of a golden
age was commoner than that of a personal prince who
should reign in equity and peace. Neither was part of the
national faith, like the law, or the doctrine of sacrifice; and
but a few of the prophets portrayed a king, in their description
of the period of ideal prosperity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The man who first gave public sanction to a portion of the
national literature was Ezra, who laid the foundation of a
canon. He was the leader in restoring the theocracy after
the exile, <span class="tei tei-q">“a ready scribe in the law of Moses, who had
prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to teach
in Israel statutes and judgments.”</span> As we are told that he
brought the book of the law of Moses before the congregation
and read it publicly, the idea naturally arises that he
was the final redactor of the Pentateuch, separating it from
the historical work consisting of Joshua and the subsequent
writings, of which it formed the commencement. Such was
the first canon given to the Jewish Church after its reconstruction—ready
for temple service as well as synagogue
use. Henceforward the Mosaic book became an authoritative
guide in spiritual, ecclesiastical, and civil matters, as
we infer from various passages in Ezra and Nehemiah and
from the chronicler's own statements in the book bearing
his name. The doings of Ezra with regard to the Scriptures
are deduced not only from what we read of him in the Biblical
book that bears his name, but also from the legend in
the fourth book of Ezdras,<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> where it is related that he dictated
by inspiration to five ready writers ninety-four books;
the first twenty-four of which he was ordered to publish
openly that the worthy and unworthy might read, but reserved
the last seventy for the wise. Though the twenty-four
books of the Old Testament cannot be attributed to
him, the fact that he copied and wrote portions need not be
questioned. He edited <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the law</span></em>, making the first canon or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
collection of books, and giving it an authority which it had
not before. Talmudic accounts associate with him the men
of the great synagogue. It is true that they are legendary,
but there is a foundation of fact beneath the fanciful superstructure.
As to Ezra's treatment of the Pentateuch, or his
specific mode of redaction, we are left for the most part to
conjecture. Yet it is safe to affirm that he added;—making
new precepts and practices either in place of or beside older
ones. Some things he removed as unsuited to the altered
circumstances of the people; others he modified. He threw
back later enactments into earlier times. It is difficult to
discover all the parts that betray his hand. Some elaborate
priestly details show his authorship most clearly. If his
hand be not visible in Leviticus, chap. xvii.-xxvi.; a writer
not far removed from his time is observable; Ezekiel or
some other. It is clear that some of the portion (xxv. 19-22;
xxvi. 3-45) is much later than the Elohists, and belongs
to the exile or post-exile period. But great difficulty
attaches to the separation of the sources here used; even
after Kayser's acute handling of them. It is also perceptible
from Ezekiel xx. 25, 26, that the clause in Exodus xiii. 15,
<span class="tei tei-q">“but all the first-born of my children I redeem,”</span> was
added after the exile, since the prophet shows his unacquaintance
with it. The statute that all which openeth the
womb should be burnt in sacrifice to Jehovah, appeared inhuman
not only to Ezekiel, but to Ezra or his associates in
re-editing the law; and therefore the clause about the redemption
of every first-born male was subjoined. Ezra, a
second Moses in the eyes of the later Jews, did not scruple
to refer to Moses what was of recent origin, and to deal
freely with the national literature. Such was the first
canon—that of Ezra the priest and scribe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The origin of the great synagogue is noticed in Ezra x.
16, and described more particularly in Nehemiah viii.-x.,
the members being apparently enumerated in x. 1-27; at
least the Megila Jer. (i. 5) and Midrash Ruth (§ 3) speak
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of an assembly of eighty-five elders, who are probably found
in the last passage. One name, however, is wanting, for
only eighty-four are given; and as Ezra is not mentioned
among them, the conjecture of Krochmal that it has dropped
out of x. 9, may be allowed. Another tradition gives the
number as one hundred and twenty, which may be got by
adding the <span class="tei tei-q">“chief of the fathers”</span> enumerated in Ezra viii.
1-14 to the hundred and two heads of families in Ezra ii. 2-58.
Whether the number was the same at the commencement
as afterwards is uncertain. Late Jewish writers,
however, such as Abarbanel, Abraham ben David, Ben
Maimun, &amp;c., speak as if it consisted of the larger number
at the beginning; and have no scruple in pronouncing Ezra
president, rather than Nehemiah.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>

else; the former in the first part of the passage, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editing</span></em>
in the second? Rashi explains it of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composition</span></em> throughout,
which introduces absurdity. The most obvious interpretation
is that which understands the verb of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">writing</span></em> in one
place, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editing</span></em> in the second. But it is improbable that
the author should have used the same word in different
senses, in one and the same passage. Bloch<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> understands it of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">copying</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">writing out</span></em>, a sense that suits the procedure of
the men of the great synagogue in regard to Ezekiel, the
twelve prophets, &amp;c., but is inapplicable to Moses, Joshua,
Samuel, David, Jeremiah, &amp;c. It is probable enough that
the synagogue scribes put into their present form and made
the first authorized copies of the works specified. The
Boraitha, however, is not clear, and may only express the
opinion of a private individual in a confused way. Simon
the Just is said to have belonged to the remnants of the
synagogue. As Ezra is called <span class="tei tei-q">“a ready scribe,”</span> and his
labors in connection with the law were important, he may
have organized a body of literary men who should work in
harmony, attending, among other things, to the collection
and preservation of the national literature; or they may
have been an association of patriotic men who voluntarily
rallied round the heads of the new state, to support them in
their fundamental reforms. The company of scribes mentioned
in 1 Maccabees does not probably relate to it.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> A
succession of priests and scribes, excited at first by the reforming
zeal of one whom later Jews looked upon as a
second Moses, labored in one department of literary work
till the corporation ceased to exist soon after, if not in the

not with Simon I., son and successor of the high-priest
Onias I., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 310-291. Josephus's opinion, indeed, is contrary;
but leading Jewish scholars, such as Zunz, Herzfeld,
Krochmal, Derenbourg, Jost, and Bloch differ from him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the great synagogue must be referred the compilation
of the second canon, containing Joshua, Judges with Ruth,
Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah with Lamentations, Ezekiel
and the twelve minor prophets. It was not completed prior
to 300 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, because the book of Jonah was not written before.
This work may be called a historical parable composed
for a didactic purpose, giving a milder, larger view of Jehovah's
favor than the orthodox one, that excluded the
Gentiles. Ruth, containing an idyllic story with an unfinished
genealogy attached, meant to glorify the house of
David, and presenting a kindred spirit towards a people
uniformly hated, was appended to Judges; but was subsequently
transferred to the third canon. It was written
immediately after the return from the Babylonian captivity;
for the Chaldaising language points to this date, notwithstanding
the supposed archaisms discovered in it by some.
In like manner, the Lamentations, originally added to Jeremiah,
were afterwards put into the later or third canon.
Joshua, which had been separated from the five books of
Moses with which it was closely joined at first, formed, with
the other historical portion (Judges, Samuel, Kings), the
proper continuation of Ezra's canon. The prophets included
the three greater and twelve minor. With Isaiah's authentic
oracles were incorporated the last twenty-seven chapters,
belonging for the most part to an anonymous prophet of the
exile, besides several late pieces inserted in the first thirty-nine
chapters. Men of prophetic gifts wrote in the name of
distinguished prophets, and put their productions with those
of the latter, or adapted and wrote them over after their own
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fashion. The fiftieth and fifty-first chapters of Jeremiah
show such over-writing. To Zechariah's authentic oracles
were attached chapters ix.-xiv., themselves made up of two
parts (ix.-xi., xii.-xiv.) belonging to different times and
authors prior to the destruction of the Jewish state by the
Babylonians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The character of the synagogue's proceedings in regard
to the books of Scripture can only be deduced from the conduct
of Ezra himself, as well as the prevailing views and
wants of the times. The scribes who began with Ezra, seeing
how he acted, would naturally follow his example, not hesitating to
revise the text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in substance</span></em> as well as form.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>
They did not refrain from changing what had been written,
or from inserting fresh matter. Some of their novelties can
be discerned even in the Pentateuch. Their chief work,
however, related to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> of the text. They put into a
proper form and state the text of the writings they studied,
perceiving less need for revising the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em>. What they did
was in good faith, with honest intention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophetic canon ended with Malachi's oracles. And
it was made sometime after he prophesied, because the
general consciousness that the function ceased with him required
a considerable period for its growth. The fact that
it included Jonah and Ruth brings the completion after 300
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, as already stated. There are no definite allusions to it
till the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Daniel speaks of a passage in
Jeremiah being in <span class="tei tei-q">“the books”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“writings;”</span><a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> and the
prologue of Jesus Sirach presupposes its formation. Such
was the second canon, which had been made up gradually
(444-290 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>)
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another view of the collection in question has been taken
by various scholars. According to a passage in the second
book of Maccabees, the second canon originated with Nehemiah,
who <span class="tei tei-q">“gathered together the acts of the kings and the
prophets and (psalms) of David, and the epistles of the
kings concerning the holy gifts.”</span><a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> These words are obscure.
They occur in a letter purporting to be sent by the Sanhedrim
at Jerusalem to the Jews in Egypt, which contains
apocryphal things; a letter which assigns to Nehemiah the
merit of various arrangements rather belonging to Ezra. It
is difficult to understand the meaning of <span class="tei tei-q">“the epistles of the
kings concerning the offerings.”</span> If they were the documents
of heathen or Persian kings favorable to the rebuilding
of Jerusalem and its temple, would they not have been
rejected from a collection of sacred books belonging to the
chosen people? They might perhaps have been adopted
had they been interwoven with the holy books themselves,
like portions of Ezra and Nehemiah; but they could not
have formed a distinct part of the national literature, because
they were foreign and heathen. Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“the psalms of
David”</span> cannot have existed in the time of Nehemiah, if the
phrase includes the whole collection. It may perhaps refer
to the first three divisions of the book, as Herzfeld thinks;
but these contain many odes which are not David's; while
earlier ones belong to the last two divisions of the Psalm-book.
In like manner, <span class="tei tei-q">“the prophets”</span> could not all have
belonged to this canon; neither Malachi, who was later, nor
Jonah. The account will not bear strict examination, and
must be pronounced apocryphal. Nehemiah was a statesman,
not a priest or scribe; a politician, not a literary man.
It is true that he may have had assistants, or committed the
work to competent hands; but this is conjectural. The account
of his supposed canon hardly commends itself by inherent
truthfulness or probability, though it is accepted by
Ewald and Bleek.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the great synagogue ceased, there was an interval
during which it is not clear whether the sacred books were
neglected, except by private individuals; or whether they
were studied, copied, and collected by a body of scribes.
Perhaps the scribes and elders of the Hasmonæan time were
active at intervals in this department. The institution of
a senate by Judas Maccabaeus is supposed to be favored by
2 Maccabees (chapter i. 10-ii. 18); but the passage furnishes
poor evidence of the thing. Judas is there made to
write to Egypt in the year of the Seleucidae 188, though he
died thirty-six years before, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, 152. Other places have
been added as corroborative, viz., 2 Maccab. iv. 44, xi. 27;
1 Maccab. vii. 33. Some go so far as to state that Jose ben
Joeser was appointed its first president at that time. The
Midrash in Bereshith Rabba (§ 65) makes him one of the
sixty Hassidim who were treacherously murdered by Alcimus;
but this is neither in the first book of the Maccabees
(chapter vii.) nor in Josephus,<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> and must be pronounced
conjectural. It is impossible to fix the exact date of Jose
ben Joeser in the Hasmonean period. Pirke Aboth leaves
it indefinite. Jonathan, Judas Maccabaeus's successor,
when writing to the Lacedaemonians, speaks of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gerusia</span></span>
or senate as well as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the people</span></em> of the Jews; whence we learn
that the body existed as early as the time of Judas.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> Again,
Demetrius writes to Simon, as also to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the elders</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nation</span></em>
of the Jews.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>
After Jonathan and Simon, it may have been
suspended for a while, in consequence of the persecution
and anarchy prevailing in Judea; till the great Sanhedrim
at Jerusalem succeeded it, under Hyrcanus I. Though the
traces of a senate in the Maccabaean epoch are slight, the
Talmud countenances its existence.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> We believe that it was
earlier than Judas Maccabaeus. Of its constitution nothing
is known; but it was probably aristocratic. The Hasmonean
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prince would naturally exert a commanding influence
over it. The great synagogue had been a kind of democratic
council, consisting of scribes, doctors or teachers, and
priests.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
Like their predecessors of the great synagogue,
the Hasmonæan elders revised the text freely, putting into
it explanatory or corrective additions, which were not always
improvements. The way in which they used the book of
Esther, employing it as a medium of Halachite prescription,
shows a treatment involving little idea of sacredness attaching
to the Hagiographa.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are aware that the existence of this body is liable to
doubt, and that the expressions belonging to it in Jewish
books, whether elders or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gerusia</span></span>, have been applied to
the great synagogue or to the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, or even
to the elders of any little town or hamlet; but it is difficult
to explain all on that hypothesis, without attributing confusion
to the places where they occur. If the body in
question be not allowed, an interval of about sixty years
elapsed between the great synagogue and the Sanhedrim, during
which the hagiographical writings were comparatively
neglected, though literary activity did not cease. No authoritative
association, at least, dealt with them. This is improbable.
It is true that we read of no distinguished teachers in
the interval, except Antigonus of Socho, disciple of Simon
the Just; but the silence can hardly weigh against a reasonable
presumption. One thing is clear, viz., that Antigonus
did not reach down to the time of the first pair that presided
over the Sanhedrim.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The contents of the third canon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Psalms, Proverbs,
Job, Canticles, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah,
Chronicles, the formation of which we assign to the Hasmonæan
gerusia, were multifarious, differing widely from
one another in age, character, and value—poetical, prophetic,
didactic, historical. Such as seemed worthy of preservation,
though they had not been included in the second canon,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were gathered together during the space of an hundred and
fifty years. The oldest part consisted of psalms supposed
to belong to David. The first psalm, which contains within
itself traces of late authorship, was prefixed as an introduction
to the whole collection now put into the third canon.
Next to the Psalms were Proverbs, Job, Canticles, which,
though non-prophetic and probably excluded on that account
from the second canon, must have existed before the
exile. Enriched with the latest additions, they survived the
national disasters, and claimed a place next to the Psalms.
They were but a portion of the literature current in and
after the 5th century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, as may be inferred from the epilogue
to Ecclesiastes, and the Wisdom of Sirach. The
historical work compiled by the chronicle-writer was separated,
Ezra being put first as the most important part, and
referring also to the church of the 6th and 5th centuries
whose history had not been written. The Chronicles themselves
were placed last, being considered of less value than
the first part, as they contained the summary of a period
already described, though with numerous adaptations to
post-exile times. The youngest portion consisted of the
book of Daniel, not written till the Maccabean period (between
170 and 160 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>);<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
and probably of several Psalms
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(44, 60, 74, 75, 76, 79, 80, 83, 89, 110, 118) which were inserted
in different places of the collection to make the whole
number 150. These late odes savor of the Maccabean time;
and are fitly illustrated by the history given in the first
book of Maccabees. The list continued open; dominated by
no stringent principle of selection, and with a character
somewhat indefinite. It was called <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, writings<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> a
general epithet suited to the contents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several books put into the third canon,—as Job, Proverbs,
the greater number of the Psalms, &amp;c.,—existed when the
second was made. But the latter collection was pre-eminently
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic</span></em>; and it was that idea of the origin and
contents of the books in it which regulated its extent.
Bloch's supposition that the parts of the third collection then
existing were not looked upon as holy, but merely as productions
embodying human wisdom, and were therefore
excluded, is improbable. We do not think that an alteration
of opinion about them in the course of a century or
more, by which they became divine and holy instead of
human, is a satisfactory explanation. The Psalms of David
and the book of Job must have been as highly esteemed in
the period of the great synagogue's existence as they were
at a later time. Other considerations besides the divinity
and holiness of books contributed to their introduction into
a canon. Ecclesiastes was taken into the third collection
because it was attributed to Solomon. The Song of Songs
was understood allegorically,—a fact which, in addition to
its supposed Solomonic authorship, determined its adoption.
And even after their canonical reception, whether by the
great synagogue or another body, the character of books
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was canvassed. It was so with Ecclesiastes, in spite of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supposed</span></em> sanction it got from the great synagogue contained
in the epilogue, added, as some think, by that body to attest
the sacredness of the book.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the third canon was being made, the soferim, as
the successors of the prophets, were active as before; and
though interpretation was their chief duty, they must have
revised and corrected the sacred books to some extent. We
need not hesitate to allow that they sometimes arranged
parts, and even added matter of their own. In the time of the
canon's entire preparation, they and the priests, with writers
and scholars generally, redacted the national literature, excluding
or sanctioning such portions of it as they thought fit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this time appeared the present five-fold partition of the
Psalms, preceded as it had been by other divisions, the last
of which was very similar to the one that became final.
Several inscriptions and historical notices were prefixed.
The inscriptions, however, belong to very different times,
their historical parts being usually older than the musical;
and date from the first collection to the period of the Hasmonean
college, when the final redaction of the entire
Psalter took place. Those in the first three books existed
at the time when the latter were made up; those in the last
two were prefixed partly at the time when the collections
themselves were made, and partly in the Maccabean age.
How often they are out of harmony with the poems themselves,
needs no remark. They are both traditional and
conjectural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest attestation of the third canon is that of the
prologue to Jesus Sirach (130 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), where not only
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the law
and the prophets</span></em> are specified, but <span class="tei tei-q">“the other books of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

given as to its extent, or the particular books included.
They may have been for the most part the same as the
present ones. The passage does not show that the third list
was closed. The better writings of the fathers, such as
tended to learning and wisdom, are not excluded by the
definite article. In like manner, neither Philo nor the New
Testament gives exact information as to the contents of the
division in question. Indeed, several books, Canticles,
Esther, Ecclesiastes, are unnoticed in the latter. The argument
drawn from Matthew xxiii. 35, that the Chronicles
were then the last book of the canon, is inconclusive; as
the Zechariah there named was probably different from the
Zechariah in 2 Chronicles xxiv. None of these witnesses
proves that the third canon was finally closed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A more definite testimony respecting the canon is given
by Josephus towards the end of the first century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“For
we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, ...
but only twenty-two books, which contain the
records of all the past times; which are justly believed to
be divine. And of them five belong to Moses....
But as to the time from the death of Moses till the reign of
Artaxerxes, king of Persia, the prophets who were after
Moses wrote down what was done in their times in thirteen
books. The remaining four books contain hymns to God
and precepts for the conduct of human life. It is true our
history has been written since Artaxerxes very particularly,
but has not been esteemed of the like authority with the
former by our forefathers, because there has not been an
exact succession of prophets since that time: and how
firmly we have given credit to these books of our own nation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is evident by what we do; for during so many ages as
have already passed, no one has been so bold as either to
add anything to them, to take anything from them, or to
make any change in them; but it has become natural to all
Jews immediately and from their very birth, to esteem these
books to contain divine doctrines, and to persist in them, and if occasion
be, willingly to die for them.”</span><a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> This list
agrees with our present canon, showing that the Palestinian
Jews were tolerably unanimous as to the extent of the collection.
The thirteen prophets include Job; the four lyric
and moral books are Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and
Canticles.

It is not likely that the Hasmonæan senate had a long existence.
It was replaced by the Sanhedrim, a more definite
and state institution, intended as a counter-balance to the
influence of the Hasmonæan princes. The notices of the
latter reach no further back than Hyrcanus I., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, about

Frankel<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> indeed, finds a notice of it in 2 Chronicles xix. 8,
11; but the account there is indistinct, and refers to the
great synagogue. The compiler having no certain information
about what was long past, transfers the origin of the
court he speaks of to Jehoshaphat, in order to glorify the
house of David. It is impossible to date the Sanhedrim,
with Frankel, in the Grecian era, in which case it must have
been dissolved during the Maccabean insurrection, and
afterwards reconstructed; it was not constituted till about
130 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Whether it was modeled after the great synagogue
or the Hasmonæan senate, is uncertain. The idea of it may
have been suggested by the latter rather than the former,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must have been less formal and definite than the Sanhedrim;
though the latter arose before the family ceased to be in
power, and differed materially from its predecessor. It continued
from 130 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> till
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 180, surviving the terrible

The closing of the third canon cannot be assigned, with
Bloch, to the great synagogue. If the college ceased with
or before Simon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, about 200-192, and the work of Daniel
did not appear till about 170 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, twenty years at least
intervened between the extinction of the great synagogue
and Daniel's book. This holds good, whether we assume,
with Krochmal, the synagogue's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">redaction</span></em> of the work,—more
correctly the putting together of the independent parts
of which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is said</span></em> to be composed; or equally so, if the taking
of it into the canon as a book already completed, be attributed
to the same body. But we are unable to see that
Krochmal's reasoning about the synagogue putting Daniel's
work together and one of the members writing the book of
Esther is probable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner, Maccabean psalms are adverse to the
hypothesis that the great synagogue completed the third
canon. In consequence of these late productions, it is impossible
to assert that the men of the synagogue were the
redactors of the Psalter as it is. It is true that the collection
was made before the Chronicles and many other books
of the hagiographical canon; but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em> Psalter did
not appear till the Maccabean period. The canon, however,
was not considered to be finally closed in the first century
before and the next after Christ. There were doubts about
some portions. The book of Ezekiel gave offence, because
some of its statements seemed to contradict the law. Doubts
about others were of a more serious nature; about Ecclesiastes,
the Canticles, Esther, and the Proverbs. The first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was impugned because it had contradictory passages and a
heretical tendency; the second, because of its worldly and
sensual tone; Esther for its want of religiousness; and
Proverbs on account of inconsistencies. This scepticism
went far to procure the exclusion of the suspected works
from the canon, and their relegation to the class of the
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">genuzim</span></span>.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>
But it did not prevail. Hananiah, son of Hezekiah,
son of Garon, about 32 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, is said to have reconciled
the contradictions and quieted the doubts.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>
But these traces of resistance to the fixity of the canon were not the last.
They reappeared about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 65, as we learn from the
Talmud,<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>
when the controversy turned mainly upon the canonicity
of Ecclesiastes, which the school of Shammai, who had
the majority, opposed; so that the book was probably excluded.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>
The question emerged again at a later synod at
Jabneh or Jamnia, when R. Eleasar ben Asaria was chosen
patriarch, and Gamaliel the second, deposed. Here it was
decided, not unanimously however, but by a majority of
Hillelites, that Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs <span class="tei tei-q">“pollute
the hands,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, belong properly to the
Hagiographa.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> This
was about 90 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
Thus the question of the canonicity of
certain books was discussed at two synods.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Passages in the Talmud have been adduced to show that
the Shammaite objections to the canonicity of Ecclesiastes
<span class="tei tei-q">“were overruled by the positive declaration from the 72
elders, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being a testimony anterior to the Christian era</span></em> that
Coheleth is canonical; but they do not support the opinion.”</span><a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The sages”</span> referred to in the treatise Sabbat and elsewhere
is a vague expression, resting apparently on no historic
tradition—a mere opinion of comparatively late date. If it
refer to the Jerusalem synod <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 65, the Hillelites were
simply outnumbered there by the Shammaites. The matter
was debated hastily, and determined for the time by a
majority. But the synod at Jamnia consisted of 72 persons;
and a passage in the treatise Yadayim refers to it.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> The
testimony of the 72 elders to whom R. Simeon ben Asai
here alludes, so far from belonging to an anti-christian era,
belongs to a date about 90 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> And the fact that the synod
at Jamnia took up again a question already debated at
Jerusalem <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 65, proves that no final settlement of the
canon had taken place before. The canon was virtually
settled at Jamnia, where was confirmed what R. Akiba said
of the Canticles in his usual extravagant way: <span class="tei tei-q">“No day in
the whole history of the world is of so much worth as the
one in which the Song of Songs was given to Israel; for all
the Scriptures are holy; but the Song of Songs is most
holy.”</span><a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>
As the Hagiographa were not read in public, with
the exception of Esther, opinions of the Jewish rabbins
might still differ about Canticles and Ecclesiastes, even
after the synod of Jamnia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In opposition to these remarks, it is strenuously argued
by Bloch that neither the passage in the Mishnic treatise
Yadayim, nor any other, refers to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical character</span></em> of
the books to which Jewish elders raised several objections.
But his arguments are more vehement than valid. Anxious
to assign the final settlement of the entire canon to an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
authoritative body like the great synagogue, he affirms that
all parties were united in opinion about the time of Christ,—Assiim,
Perushim, and Zeddukim; Shammaites and Hillelites.
But it requires more than his ingenuity to explain
away the meaning of Yadayim 3, 5, Adoyot v. 3, Sabbat 1.
To what did such diversity of opinion relate, if not to the
canonical character of the books? A specific answer to the
question is not given by the learned writer,<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> who is too eager
in his endeavor to attribute the settlement of the third canon
to the great synagogue, and to smooth away all diversities
of opinion about several books, after that time, as if none
could afterwards question the authoritative settlement by
that body. He will not even allow a wider canon to the
Alexandrian Jews than that of their Palestinian brethren,
though he cannot but admit that the former read and highly
esteemed various apocryphal books because of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theocratic</span></em>
character. Surely the practical use of writings is an evidence
of their canonicity as strong as theoretical opinions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doubts about several books to which we have alluded,
some of which Hananiah is said to have resolved in his old
age, imply a diligent study of the national literature, if not
a revision of the text; and the Tannaite college at Jabneh
must have cared for the same things, as it had to deal with
similar objections. After the last canon was made more
than a century anterior to the Christian era, the text was
not considered inviolate by the learned Jews; it received
subsequent modifications and interpolations. The process
of redaction had not ceased before the time of Christ. This
was owing, among other causes, to the state of parties
among the Jews, as well as the intrusion of Greek literature
and culture, whose influence the Palestinian Jews themselves
were not able altogether to withstand. When Jeremiah
accused the Scribes of falsifying the law by their
lying pen (viii. 8), it may be inferred that the same process
took place afterwards; that offensive things were removed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and alterations made continuously down to the close of the
canon, and even after. The corrections consisted of additions
and changes of letters, being indicated in part by the
most ancient versions and the traditions of the Jews themselves
who often knew what stood in the text at first, and
why it was altered. They are also indicated by the nature
of the passage itself viewed in the light of the state of religion
at the time. Here, sober judgment must guard against
unnecessary conjectures. Some changes are apparent, as
the plural <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oaks</span></em> in Genesis xiii. 18, xiv. 13, xviii. 1, Deuteronomy
xi. 30, for the singular <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oak</span></em>; and the plural <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gods</span></em> in
Exodus xxxii. 4, for the singular <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">god</span></em>. So 2 Sam. Vii. 23,
(comp. 1 Chron. xvii. 21, and LXX);<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> and Deuteronomy
xxxii. 8,<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> have been altered. Popper and Geiger have
probably assumed too much correction on the part of the
Scribes and others; though they have drawn attention to
the subject in the spirit of original criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jewish literature began to degenerate after the captivity,
and it continued to do so. It leaned upon the past more and
more, having an external and formal character with little
of the living soul. The independence of their religious
literature disappeared with the national independence of the
Jews; and the genius of the people was too exclusive to receive
much expansion from the spirit of nations with whom
they came in contact. In such circumstances, amid the
general consciousness of present misfortune which the hope
of a brighter future could not dispel, and regretful retrospects
of the past tinged with ideal splendor, the exact time
of drawing a line between books that might be included in
the third division of the canon must have been arbitrary.
In the absence of a normal principle to determine selection,
the productions were arbitrarily separated. Not that they
were badly adjusted. On the contrary, the canon as a whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was settled wisely. Yet the critical spirit of learned Jews
in the future could not be extinguished by anticipation.
The canon was not really settled for all time by a synodical
gathering at Jamnia; for Sirach was added to the Hagiographa
by some rabbins about the beginning of the 4th
century;<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
while Baruch circulated long in Hebrew, and was
publicly read on the day of atonement in the third century,
according to the Apostolic constitutions.<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> These two books
were in high repute for a considerable time, possessing a
kind of canonical credit even among the learned Jews of
Palestine. Rab, Jochanan, Elasar, Rabba bar Mare, occasionally
refer to Sirach in the way in which the
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span> were
quoted: the writer of Daniel used Baruch; and the translator
of Jeremiah put it into Greek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If it be asked on what principle books were admitted into
the canon, a single answer does not suffice. One and the
same criterion did not determine the process at all times.
The leading principle with which the first canon-makers set
out was to collect all the documents of Hebrew antiquity.
This seems to have guided Ezra, if not the great synagogue
after him. The nation, early imbued with the theocratic
spirit and believing itself the chosen of God, was favorably
inclined towards documents in which that standpoint was
assumed. The legal and ethical were specially valued.
The prophetic claimed a divine origin; the lyric or poetic
touched and elevated the ideal faculty on which religion
acts. But the leading principle which actuated Ezra and
the great synagogue was gradually modified, amid the growing
compass of the national literature and the consciousness
that prophecy ceased with Malachi. When the latest part
of the canon had to be selected from a literature almost contemporaneous,
regard was had to such productions as resembled
the old in spirit. Orthodoxy of contents was the
dominant criterion. But this was a difficult thing, for various
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
works really anonymous, though wearing the garb of
old names and histories, were in existence, so that the
boundary of the third part became uncertain and fluctuating.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principle that actuated Ezra in making the first canon
was a religious and patriotic one. From his treatment of
the oldest law books we infer that he did not look upon
them as inviolable. Venerable they were, and so far sacred;
but neither perfect nor complete for all time. In his view
they were not unconditionally authoritative. Doubtless
they had a high value as the productions of inspired lawgivers
and men of a prophetic spirit; but the redaction to
which he submitted them shows no superstitious reverence.
With him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holy</span></em> were not identical. Nor does
the idea of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate, divine</span></em> authority appear to have
dominated the mind of the great synagogue in the selection
of books. Like Ezra, these scholars reverenced the productions
of the prophets, poets, and historians to whom their
countrymen were indebted in the past for religious or political
progress; but they did not look upon them as the
offspring of unerring wisdom. How could they, while
witnessing repetitions and minor contradictions in the books
collected?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same remarks apply to the third canon. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Direct divinity</span></em>
of origin was not the criterion which determined the
reception of a book into it; but the character and authorship
of the book. Did it breathe the old spirit, or proceed
from one venerated for his wisdom? Was it like the old
orthodox productions; or did it bear the name of one renowned
for his piety and knowledge of divine things? The
stamp of antiquity was necessary in a certain sense; but the
theocratic spirit was the leading consideration. Ecclesiastes
was admitted because it bore the name of Solomon; and
Daniel's apocalyptic writings, because veiled under the name
of an old prophet. New psalms were taken in because of
their association with much older ones in the temple service.
Yet the first book of Maccabees was excluded, though written
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Hebrew. It is still more remarkable that Sirach was
put among the external productions; but this was owing
not so much to its recent origin, for it is older than the book
of Daniel, as to its being an apparent echo of the Proverbs,
and therefore unnecessary. Yet it was long after assigned
to the Hagiographa, and quoted as such by several rabbis.
Baruch was also left out, though it is as old as Daniel, if
not older; and professes to have been written by Jeremiah's
friend, in Babylon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That redactors dealt freely with the text of the second
and third canons especially, without a superstitious belief
in its sacredness, is apparent from the double recension
which existed when the Egyptian Jews translated the books
into Greek. If the one that formed the basis of the Alexandrian
version be less correct than the Palestinian in the
majority of instances, it is still superior in many. The
differences between them, often remarkable, prove that those
who had most to do with the books did not guard them as
they would have done had they thought them infallibly inspired.
Palestinians and Alexandrians subjected the text
to redaction; or had suffered it to fall into a state inconsistent
with the assumption of its supernatural origin. At a
much later period, the Masoretes reduced to one type all existing
copies of their Scriptures, introducing an uniformity
imperatively demanded in their opinion by multiplied discrepancies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever divine character the reflecting attributed to the
canonical books, it must have amounted to the same thing as
that assigned to human attributes and physical phenomena—a
divinity resulting from the over-leaping of second
causes, in the absence of inductive philosophy. Here the
imperfection conditioned by the nature of the created cannot
be hid. Yet the books may be truly said to have contained
the word of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the three divisions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Law</span></em> or Pentateuch was most
highly venerated by the Jews. It was the first translated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into Greek; and in Philo's view was inspired in a way
peculiar to itself. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Prophets</span></em>, or second division, occupied
a somewhat lower place in their estimation, but were read
in the public services as the law had been before. The
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span>,
or third division, was not looked upon as equal to the
Prophets in importance: only the five Megiloth were publicly
read. The three parts of the collection present the
three gradations of sanctity which the books assumed successively
in Israelite estimation. A certain reverence was
attached to all as soon as they were made canonical; but
the reverence was not of equal height, and the supposed
authority was proportionally varied.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> The consciousness
of prophetism being extinct soon after the return from
Babylon, was a genuine instinct. With the extinction of
the Jewish state the religious spirit almost evaporated.
The idealism which the old prophets proclaimed in contrast
with the symbolic religion of the state gave place to the
forms and an attachment to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">written</span></em> law. Religion came
to be a thing of the understanding, the subject of learned
treatment; and its essence was reduced to dogmas or precepts.
Thus it ceased to be a spiritual element in which
the heart had free scope for its highest aspirations. In
addition to all, a foreign metaphysical theology, the Persian
doctrine of spirits, was introduced, which seemed to enlarge
the sphere of speculation, but really retarded the free exercise
of the mind. As the external side of religion had been
previously directed to the performance of good works, this
externality was now determined by a written law. Even
the prophetism that appeared after the restoration was little
more than an echo of the past, falling in with an outward
and written legalism. The literature of the people deteriorated
in quality, and prophecy became <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apocalypse</span></em>. In such
circumstances the advent of a new man was needed to restore
the free life of religion in higher power. Christ appeared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the fullness of time to do this effectually by proclaiming
the divine Fatherhood, and founding a worship <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in spirit and
in truth</span></em>. Rising above the symbolic wrappings of the
Mosaic religion, and relying upon the native power of the
spirit itself, he showed how man may mount up to the
throne of God, adoring the Supreme without the intervention
of temple, sacrifice, or ceremony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the three divisions were united, the ecclesiastical
respect which had gathered round the law and the prophets
from ancient times began to be transferred to the
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span>. A
belief in their sanctity increased apace in the 1st century
before the Christian era, so that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacredness</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonicity</span></em>
were almost identical. The doubts of individuals, it is true,
were still expressed respecting certain books of the
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span>,
but they had no perceptible effect upon the current opinion.
The sanctity attaching to the last division as well as the
others did not permit the total displacement of any part.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The passage in Josephus already quoted shows the state
of the canon about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 100. According to it, he considered
it to have been closed at the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus,
whom he identifies with the Ahasuerus of Esther, 464-424
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The books were divine, so that none dared to add to,
subtract from, or alter them. To him the canon was something
belonging to the venerable past, and inviolable. In
other words, all the books were peculiarly sacred. Although
we call scarcely think this to be his private opinion merely,
it is probably expressed in exaggerated terms, and hardly
tallies with his use of the third Esdras in preference to the
canonical texts.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> His authority, however, is small. Bloch's
estimate of it is too high. It is utterly improbable that
Josephus's opinion was universally held by the Jews in his
day. His division of the books is peculiar: five Mosaic,
thirteen historical, four containing religious songs and rules
of life. It appears, indeed, that as he had the same twenty-two
books we now have, Ruth was still attached to Judges,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Lamentations to Jeremiah; but his credit is not on a
par with that of a Jew who adhered to his countrymen in
the time of their calamity. He wrote for the Romans. One
who believed that Esther was the youngest book in the
canon, who looked upon Ecclesiastes as Solomon's, and
Daniel as an exile production, cannot be a competent judge.
In his time the historical sense of the book of Daniel was
misapprehended; for after the Grecian dynasty had fallen
without the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy connected
with it, the Roman empire was put into its place. Hence various allusions in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The History of the Jewish Wars</span></span>.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> The passage in the

the priests in the Temple at Jerusalem is apocryphal. In
any case, Josephus does not furnish a genuine list of the
canonical books any more than Philo. The Pharisaic view
of his time is undoubtedly given, that the canon was then
complete and sacred. The decision proceeded from that
part of the nation who ruled both over school and people,
and regained supremacy after the destruction of the temple;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from the Pharisee-sect to which Josephus belonged. It
was a conclusion of orthodox Judaism. With true critical
instinct, Spinoza says that the canon was the work of the
Pharisees. The third collection was undoubtedly made
under their influence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The origin of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">threefold</span></em> division of the canon is not, as
Oehler supposes,<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> a reflection of the different stages of religious
development through which the nation passed, as if
the foundation were the Law, the ulterior tendency in its
objective aspect the Prophets, and its subjective aspect the
Hagiographa. The books of Chronicles and others refute
this arbitrary conception. The triplicity lies in the manner
in which the books were collected. Men who belonged to
different periods and possessed different degrees of culture,
worked successively in the formation of the canon; which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
arose out of the circumstances of the times, and the subjective
ideas of those who made it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The places of the separate books within the first division
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Torah</span></span>, were determined by the succession of the historical
events narrated. The second division naturally begins with
Moses's successor, Joshua. Judges, Samuel, and Kings
follow according to the regular chronology. To the former
prophets, as Joshua—Kings were called, the latter were attached,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; succeeded by the
twelve minor prophets, arranged for the most part according
to their times, though the length of individual prophecies
and similarity of contents also influenced their position.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The arrangement of books in the third division depended
on their age, character, and authors. The Psalms were put
first, because David was supposed to be the author of many,
and on account of their intrinsic value in promoting the
religious life of the people. After the Psalms came the
three poetical works attributed to Solomon, with the book
of Job among them,—Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ecclesiastes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The book of Esther followed, since it was intended to
further the observance of the Purim feast; with the late
book of Daniel. The position of Daniel among the
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span>
arises solely from the fact of its posterior origin to the
prophetic writings, not excepting the book of Jonah itself;
and the attempt to account for its place in the third division
on the ground of its predominant subjectivity is based on
the unfounded assumption that the objective state of religion
is represented in the second division and the subjective
in the third. Had the book existed before 400 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, it
would doubtless have stood in the second division. But the
contents themselves demonstrate its date; contemporary
history being wrapped in a prophetic form. Having some
affinity to Esther as regards heathenism and Greek life, the
book was put next to the latter. To Ezra and Nehemiah,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which were adopted before the other part of the Chronicle book
and separated from it, were added the so-called Chronicles.
Such was the original succession of the third division
or <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span>;
but it did not remain unaltered. For the use
of the synagogue, the five Megiloth were put together; so
that Ruth, which was originally appended to Judges, and
the Lamentations affixed at first to Jeremiah's prophecies,
were taken out of the second and put into the third canon.
This caused a separation of Canticles and Ecclesiastes. The
new arrangement was made for liturgical purposes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Samaritan canon consists of the Pentateuch alone.
This restricted collection is owing to the fact, that
when the Samaritans separated from the Jews and began
their worship on Gerizim, no more than the Mosaic writings
had been invested by Ezra with canonical dignity.
The hostile feeling between the rivals hindered the reception
of books subsequently canonized. The idea of their
having the oldest and most sacred part in its entirety satisfied
their spiritual wants. Some have thought that the
Sadducees, who already existed as a party before the Maccabean
period, agreed with the Samaritans in rejecting all
but the Pentateuch; yet this is doubtful. It is true that
the Samaritans themselves say so;<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> and that some of the
church fathers, Origen, Jerome, and others agree; but little
reliance can be put on the statement. The latter, perhaps,
confounded the Samaritans and Sadducces. It is also noteworthy
that Christ in refuting the Sadducees appeals to the
Pentateuch alone; yet the conclusion, that he did so because
of their admitting no more than that portion does not follow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Alexandrian canon differed from the Palestinian.
The Greek translation commonly called the Septuagint contains
some later productions which the Palestinian Jews did
not adopt, not only from their aversion to Greek literature
generally, but also from the recent origin of the books, perhaps
also their want of prophetic sanction. The closing
line of the third part in the Alexandrian canon was more or
less fluctuating—capable of admitting recent writings appearing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under the garb of old names and histories, of
embracing religious subjects; while the Palestinian collection
was pretty well determined, and all but finally settled.
The judgment of the Alexandrians was freer than that of
their brethren in the mother country. They had even
separated in a measure from the latter, by erecting a temple
at Leontopolis; and their enlargement of the canon was
another step of divergence. Nor had they the criterion of
language for the separation of canonical and uncanonical;
both classes were before them in the same tongue. The enlarged
canon was not formally sanctioned; it had not the
approval of the Sanhedrim; yet it was to the Alexandrians
what the Palestinian one was to the Palestinians. If Jews
who were not well acquainted with Hebrew, used the
apocryphal and canonical books alike, it was a matter of
feeling and custom; and if those who knew the old language
better, adhered to the canonical more closely, it was a matter
of tradition and language. The former set little value on
the prevalent consciousness of the race that the spirit of
prophecy was extinct; their view of the Spirit's operation
was larger. The latter clung to the past with all the more
tenacity that the old life of the nation had degenerated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Alexandrian Jews opened their minds to Greek culture
and philosophy, appropriating new ideas, and explaining
their Scriptures in accordance with wider conceptions of
the divine presence; though such adaptation turned aside
the original sense. Consciously or unconsciously they were
preparing Judaism in some degree to be the religion of
humanity. But the Rabbins shut out those enlarging influences,
confining their religion within the narrow traditions
of one people. The process by which they conserved
the old belief helped to quench its spirit, so that it became
an antique skeleton, powerless beside the new civilization
which had followed the wake of Alexander's conquests.
Rabbinical Judaism proved its incapacity for regenerating
the world; having no affinity for the philosophy of second
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
causes, or for the exercise of reason beneath the love of a
Father who sees with equal eye as God of all. Its isolation
nourished a sectarian tendency. Tradition, having no creative
power like revelation, had taken the place of it; and it
could not ward off the senility of Judaism; for its creations
are but feeble echoes of prophetic utterances, weak imitations
of poetic inspiration or of fresh wisdom. They are of
the understanding rather than the reason. The tradition
which Geiger describes as the life-giving soul of Judaism—the
daughter of revelation, enjoying the same rights with
her mother—a spiritual power that continues ever to work—an
emanation from the divine Spirit—is not, indeed, the
thing which has stiffened Judaism into Rabbinism; but
neither is it tradition proper; it is reason working upon
revelation, and moulding it into a new system. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Such tradition</span></em>
serves but to show the inability of genuine Judaism to
assimilate philosophic thought. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rationalizing</span></em> should not
be styled the operation of tradition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The truth of these remarks is evident from a comparison
of two books, exemplifying Alexandrian and Palestinian
Judaism respectively. The Wisdom of Solomon shows the
enlarging effect of Greek philosophy. Overpassing Jewish
particularism, it often approaches Christianity in doctrine
and spirit, so that some<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> have even assumed a Christian
origin for it. The Wisdom of Jesus, son of Sirach has not
the doctrine of immortality. Death is there an eternal
sleep, and retribution takes place in this life. The Jewish
theocracy is the centre of history; Israel the elect people;
and all wisdom is embodied in the law. The writer is shut
up within the old national ideas, and leans upon the writings
in which they are expressed. Thus the Hagiographical
canon of Judea, conservative as it is, and purer in a
sense, presents a narrower type than the best specimens of
the Alexandrian one. The genial breath of Aryan culture
had not expanded its Semitism.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The identity of the Palestinian and Alexandrian canons
must be abandoned, notwithstanding the contrary arguments
of Eichhorn and Movers. It is said, indeed, that Philo
neither mentions nor quotes the Greek additions; but neither
does he quote several canonical books. According to Eichhorn,
no fewer than eight of the latter are unnoticed by
him.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> Besides, he had peculiar views of inspiration, and
quoted loosely from memory. Believing as he did in the
inspiration of the Greek version as a whole, it is difficult to
think that he made a distinction between the different parts
of it. In one passage he refers to the sacred books of the
Therapeutae, a fanatical sect of Jews in Egypt, as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laws</span></em>,
oracles <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of prophets, hymns</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other books</span></em> by which knowledge
and piety are increased and perfected,”</span><a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> but this presents
little information as to the canon of the Egyptian Jews
generally; for it is precarious argumentation to say with
Herbst that they prove a twofold canon. Even if the Alexandrian
and Palestinian canons be identical, we cannot be
sure that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the other books</span></em> which the Therapeutae read as holy
besides the law, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the prophets and hymns</span></em>, differed from the
hagiographa, and so constituted another canon than the
general Egyptian one. It is quite possible that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hymns</span></em>
mean the Psalms; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the other books</span></em>, the rest of the hagiographa.
The argument for the identity of the two canons
deduced from 4 Esdras xiv. 44, &amp;c., as if the twenty-four
open books were distinguished from the other writings dictated
to Ezra, is of no force, because verisimilitude required
that an Egyptian Jew himself must make Ezra conform to
the old Palestinian canon. It is also alleged that the grandson
of Jesus Sirach, who translated his grandfather's work
during his abode in Egypt, knew no difference between the
Hebrew and Greek canon, though he speaks of the Greek
version; but he speaks as a Palestinian, without having
occasion to allude to the difference between the canonical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
books of the Palestinian and Egyptian Jews. The latter
may have reckoned the apocryphal writings in the third
division; and therefore the translator of Jesus Sirach could
recognize them in the ordinary classification. The mention
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> classes is not opposed to their presence in the third.
The general use of an enlarged canon in Egypt cannot be
denied, though it was somewhat loose, not regarded as a
completed collection, and without express rabbinical sanction.
If they did not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> recognize a canon of their
own, as De Wette says of them, they had and used one
larger than the Palestinian, without troubling themselves
about a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> sanction for it by a body of Rabbis at Jerusalem
or elsewhere. Their canon was not identical with
that of the Palestinians, and all the argumentation founded
upon Philo's non-quotation of the apocryphal books, fails to
prove the contrary. The very way in which apocryphal are
inserted among canonical books in the Alexandrian canon,
shows the equal rank assigned to both. Esdras first and
second succeed the Chronicles; Tobit and Judith are between
Nehemiah and Esther; the Wisdom of Solomon and
Sirach follow Canticles; Baruch succeeds Jeremiah; Daniel
is followed by Susanna and other productions of the same
class; and the whole closes with the three books of Maccabees.
Such is the order in the Vatican MS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The threefold division of the canon, indicating three
stages in its formation, has continued. Josephus, indeed,
gives another, based on the nature of the separate books,
not on MSS. We learn nothing from him of its history,
which is somewhat remarkable, considering that he did not
live two centuries after the last work had been added. The
account of the canon's final arrangement was evidently
unknown to him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The number of the books was variously estimated.
Josephus gives twenty-two, which was the usual number
among Christian writers in the second, third, and fourth
centuries, having been derived perhaps from the letters of
the Hebrew alphabet. Origen, Jerome, and others have it.
It continued longest among the teachers of the Greek
Church, and is even in Nicephorus's stichometry.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> The
enumeration in question has Ruth with Judges, and Lamentations
with Jeremiah. In Epiphanius<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> the number twenty-seven
is found, made by taking the alphabet enlarged with
the five final letters, and dividing Samuel, Kings, and
Chronicles into two books each. This is probably an ingenious
combination belonging to the father himself. The
Talmud has twenty-four,<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> a number which did not originate
in the Greek alphabet, else the Palestinian Jews would not
have adopted it. The synagogue did not fix it officially.
After the Pentateuch and the former prophets, which are in
the usual order, it gives Jeremiah as the first of the later,
succeeded by Ezekiel and Isaiah with the twelve minor
prophets. The Talmud knows no other reason for such an
order than that it was made according to the contents of
the prophetic books, not according to the times of the
writers. This solution is unsatisfactory. It is more probable
that chronology had to do with the arrangement.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>
After the anonymous collection or second part of Isaiah
had been joined to the first or authentic prophecies, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lateness of these oracles brought Isaiah into the third place
among the greater prophets. The Talmudic order of the
Hagiographa is Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
Canticles, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.
Here Ruth precedes the Psalter, coming as near the former
prophets as possible; for it properly belongs to them, the
contents associating it with the Judges' time. The Talmudic
order is that usually adopted in German MSS. What
is the true estimate of it? Is it a proper Talmudic regulation?
Perhaps not, else the Hebrew MSS. of the French
and Spanish Jews would not so readily have departed from
it. Bloch supposes that Baba Bathra, which gives the
arrangement of the books, is one of the apocryphal Boraithas
that proceeded from an individual teacher and had no binding
authority.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Masoretic arrangement differs from the Talmudic in
putting Isaiah before Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The Hagiographa
are, Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations,
Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra (with Nehemiah),
Chronicles.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> This is usually adopted in Spanish MSS. But
MSS. often differ arbitrarily, because transcribers did not
consider themselves bound to any one arrangement.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> According
to some, a very old testimony to the commencing
and concluding books of the third division is given by the
New Testament (Luke xxiv. 44; Matthew xxiii. 35), agreeably
to which the Psalms were first and the Chronicles last;
but this is inconclusive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Alexandrian translators, as we have seen already,
placed the books differently from the Palestinian Jews. In
their version Daniel comes after Ezekiel, so that it is put
beside the greater prophets. Was this done by Jews or
Christians? Perhaps by the latter, who put it between the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
greater and lesser prophets, or in other words, out of the
third into the second division, because of dogmatic grounds,
and so effaced a trace of the correct chronology. Little importance,
however, can be attached to the order of the
books in the Septuagint; because the work was done at
different times by different persons. But whatever may
have been the arrangement of the parts when the whole
was complete, we know that it was disturbed by Protestants
separating the apocryphal writings and putting them
all together.

The writings of the New Testament show the authors'
acquaintance with the apocryphal books. They have
expressions and ideas derived from them. Stier collected
one hundred and two passages which bear some resemblance
to others in the Apocrypha;<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> but they needed sifting, and
were cut down to a much smaller number by Bleek. They
are James i. 19, from Sirach v. 11 and iv. 29; 1 Peter i. 6, 7,
from Wisdom iii. 3-7; Hebrews xi. 34, 35, from 2 Maccabees
vi. 18-vii. 42; Hebrews i. 3, from Wisdom vii. 26, &amp;c.;
Romans i. 20-32, from Wisdom xiii.-xv.; Romans ix. 21,
from Wisdom xv. 7; Eph. vi. 13-17, from Wisdom v. 18-20; 1 Cor. ii. 10, &amp;c., from
Judith viii. 14. Others are less probable.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
When Bishop Cosin says, that <span class="tei tei-q">“in all the New
Testament we find not any one passage of the apocryphal
books to have been alleged either by Christ or His apostles
for the confirmation of their doctrine,”</span><a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> the argument,
though based on fact, is scarcely conclusive; else Esther,
Canticles, Ecclesiastes, and other works might be equally
discredited. Yet it is probable that the New Testament
writers, though quoting the Septuagint much more than the
original, were disinclined to the additional parts of the
Alexandrian canon. They were Palestinian themselves, or
had in view Judaisers of a narrow creed. Prudential
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
motives, no less than a predisposition in favor of the old
national canon, may have hindered them from expressly citing
any apocryphal production. The apostle Paul and
probably the other writers of the New Testament, believed
in the literal inspiration of the Biblical books, for he uses
an argument in the Galatian epistle which turns upon the
singular or plural of a noun.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> And as the inspiration of
the Septuagint translation was commonly held by the Christians
of the early centuries, it may be that the apostles and
evangelists made no distinction between its parts. Jude
quotes Enoch, an apocryphal work not in the Alexandrian
canon; so that he at least had no rigid notions about the
difference of canonical and uncanonical writings. Still we
know that the compass of the Old Testament canon was
somewhat unsettled to the Christians of the first century, as
it was to the Hellenist Jews themselves. It is true that the
Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms were universally recognized
as authoritative; but the extent of the third division
was indefinite, so that the non-citation of the three books
respecting which there was a difference of opinion among
the Jews may not have been accidental. Inasmuch, however,
as the Greek-speaking Jews received more books than
their Palestinian brethren, the apostles and their immediate
successors were not wholly disinclined to the use of the apocryphal
productions. The undefined boundary of the canon
facilitated also the recognition of all primitive records of
the new Revelation.

Daniel and Esther, as well as his opinion about Tobit, are
sufficiently expressed in the epistle to Africanus, so that
scattered quotations from these parts of Scripture can be
properly estimated. Of the history of Susanna he ventures to say that the

He seems to argue in favor of books used and read in
the churches, though they may be put out of the canon by
the Jews. As divine Providence had preserved the sacred
Scriptures, no alteration should be made in the ecclesiastical
tradition respecting books sanctioned by the churches
though they be external to the Hebrew canon.

Three Centuries.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first Christians relied on the Old Testament as their
chief religious book. To them it was of divine origin
and authority. The New Testament writings came into
gradual use, by the side of the older Jewish documents, according
to the times in which they appeared and the names
of their reputed authors. The Epistles of Paul were the
earliest written; after which came the Apocalypse, the
Epistle to the Hebrews, and other documents, all in the first
century. After the first gospel had undergone a process of
translation, re-writing, and interpolation, from the Aramaic
basis, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the discourses</span></em>,<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>
of which Papias of Hierapolis speaks,
until the traces of another original than the Greek were all
but effaced; it appeared in its present form early in the
second century. Soon after, that of Luke was composed,
whose prevailing Pauline tendency was not allowed to suppress
various features of a Jewish Essene type. The second
gospel, which bears evidences of its derivation from the
other synoptists, was followed by the fourth. The last
document was the so-called second Epistle of Peter. It is
manifest that tradition assumed various forms after the
death of Jesus; that legend and myth speedily surrounded
His sacred person; that the unknown writers were influenced
by the peculiar circumstances in which they stood
with respect to Jewish and Gentile Christianity; and that
their uncritical age dealt considerably in the marvelous.
That the life of the great Founder should be overlaid with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
extraneous materials, is special matter for regret. However
conscientious and truth-loving they may have been, the reporters
were unequal to their work. It is also remarkable
that so many of them should be unknown; productions being
attached to names of repute to give them greater
currency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Marcion came from Pontus to Rome (144 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>,)
he brought with him a Scripture-collection consisting of
ten Pauline epistles. With true critical instinct he did not
include those addressed to Timothy and Titus, as also the
epistle to the Hebrews. The gospel of Marcion was Luke's
in an altered state. From this and other facts we conclude
that external parties were the first who carried out the idea
of collecting Christian writings, and of putting them either
beside or over against the sacred books of the Old Testament,
in support of their systems. As to Basilides (125
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), his supposed quotations from the New Testament in
Hippolytus are too precarious to be trusted.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> Testimonies
to the <span class="tei tei-q">“acknowledged”</span> books of the New Testament as
Scripture have been transferred from his followers to himself;
so that his early witness to the canon breaks down.
It is inferred from statements in Origen and Jerome that he
had a gospel of his own somewhat like St. Luke's, but extra-canonical.
His son Isidore and succeeding disciples used
Matthew's gospel. Jerome says that Marcion and Basilides
denied the Pauline authorship of the epistle to the Hebrews
and the pastoral ones.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> It is also doubtful whether
Valentinus's (140-166 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) alleged citations from the New
Testament can be relied upon. The passages of this kind ascribed
to him by the fathers belong in a great measure to his
disciples. The fragment of a letter preserved by Clement
of Alexandria in the second book of the Stromata, has been
thought to contain references to the gospels of Matthew and
Luke; but the fact is doubtful. Nor has Henrici proved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that Valentinus used John's gospel.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> But his followers,
including Ptolemy (180 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) and Heracleon
(185-200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), quote the Gospels and
other portions of the New Testament.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a>
From Hippolytus's account of the Ophites, Peratæ,
and Sethians, we infer that the Christian writings were
much employed by them. They rarely cite an apocryphal
work. More than one hundred and sixty citations from the
New Testament have been gathered out of their writings.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a>
We may admit that these Ophites and Peratæ were of early
origin, the former being the oldest known of the Gnostic
parties; but there is no proof that the acquaintance with
the New Testament which Hippolytus attributes to them
belongs to the first rather than the second half of the second
century. The early existence of the sect does not show an
early citation of the Christian books by it, especially of
John's gospel; unless its primary were its last stage. Later
and earlier Ophites are not distinguished in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophumena</span></span>.
Hence there is a presumption that the author had the
former in view, which is favored by no mention of them occurring
in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Adversus omnes Hæreses”</span> usually appended
to Tertullian's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Præscriptiones Hæreticorum</span></span>, and by Irenæus's
derivation of their heresy from that of Valentinus. The
latter father does not even speak of the Peratæ. Clement
of Alexandria is the first who alludes to them. The early
heretics were desirous of confirming their peculiar opinions
by the writings current among Catholic Christians, so that
the formation of a canon by them began soon after the commencement
of the second century, and continued till the
end of it; contemporaneously with the development of a
Catholic Church and its necessary adjunct a Catholic canon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No New Testament canon, except a partial and unauthoritative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one, existed till the latter half of the second century,
that is, till the idea of a Catholic church began to be entertained.
The living power of Christianity in its early
stages had no need of books for its nurture. But in the
development of a church organization the internal rule of
consciousness was changed into an external one of faith.
The Ebionites or Jewish Christians had their favorite Gospels
and Acts. The gospel of Matthew was highly prized
by them, existing as it did in various recensions, of which
the gospel according to the Hebrews was one. Other documents,
such as the Revelation of John; and the preaching
of Peter, a Jewish-Christian history subsequently re-written
and employed in the Clementine Recognitions and Homilies,
were also in esteem. Even so late as 175-180 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, Hegesippus,
a Jewish Christian, does not seem to have had a
canon consisting of the four gospels and Paul's Epistles, but
appeals to <span class="tei tei-q">“the law and the prophets and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Lord</span></em>,”</span> so
that his leading principle was, the identity of Jesus's words
with the Old Testament; agreeably to the tenets of the
party he belonged to. The source whence he drew the words
of Jesus was probably the Gospel according to the Hebrews,
a document which we know he used, on the authority of
Eusebius. He does not refer to Paul except by implication in a passage given in
Photius from Stephen Gobar,<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> where
he says that such as used the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard,”</span> &amp;c., falsified the Divine Scriptures and the
Lord's words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are your eyes for they see,”</span> &amp;c.
As Paul quoted the condemned language, he is blamed.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The Clementine Homilies (161-180 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) used the four
canonical gospels even the fourth (which is somewhat
singular in a writer who denies the deity of Christ), and assigned
it to the apostle John. The gospel according to the
Egyptians was also employed. Paul's epistles were rejected
of course, as well as the Acts; since the apostle of the Gentiles
was pointed at in Simon Magus, whom Peter refutes.
It is, therefore, obvious that a collection of the New Testament
writings could make little progress among the Ebionites
of the second century. Their reverence for the law
and the prophets hindered another canon. Among the
Gentile Christians the formation of a canon took place more
rapidly, though Judaic influences retarded it even there.
After Paul's epistles were interchanged between churches,
a few of them would soon be put together. A collection of
this kind is implied in 2 Peter iii. 16. The pastoral epistles,
which show their dependence on the authentic Pauline ones,
with those of Peter, presuppose a similar collection; which
along with the Synoptists, existed before the fourth gospel.
The Apocalypse and the epistle to the Hebrews were obnoxious
to the Pauline churches, as Paul's letters were to the
Jewish-Christian ones. Hence the former were outside the
Pauline collections.

The first Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (about
120 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), implies acquaintance with several of the epistles,
with those to the Corinthians, Romans, Hebrews, and perhaps
others. Two passages have also been adduced as
derived from the gospels of Matthew and Luke, viz., in
chapters xiii. 2 and xlvi. 8; but probably some other source
supplied them, such as oral tradition. It has also been
argued that the quotation in the fifteenth chapter, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Scripture says somewhere, This people honoreth me with
their lips, but their heart is far from me,”</span> comes from Mark
vii. 6 in which it varies from the Hebrew of Isaiah xxix.
13, as well as the Septuagint version. Clement therefore, so
it is said, quotes the Old Testament through the medium of
the gospels (Matthew xv. 8, Mark vii. 6). But the argument
is inconclusive because the words agree closely enough
with the Septuagint to render the supposition very probable
that they are a memorized citation from it. As they stand,
they coincide exactly neither with Mark nor the Septuagint.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>

Barnabas (about 119 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) has but one quotation from the
New Testament, if, indeed, it be such. Apparently, Matthew
xx. 16 or xxii. 14 is introduced by <span class="tei tei-q">“as it is written,”</span> showing
that the gospel was considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> This is the
earliest trace of canonical authority being transferred from
the Old Testament to Christian writings. But the citation
is not certain. The original may be 4 Esdras, viii. 3; and
even if the writer took the words from Matthew's gospel, it
is possible that he used <span class="tei tei-q">“it is written”</span> with reference to
their prototype in the Old Testament. Of such interchanges,
examples occur in writers of the second century; and it is
the more probable that this is one, from the fact that 4
Esdras is elsewhere considered a prophet and referred to in
the same way as Ezekiel.<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a> Barnabas's citation of a gospel
as canonical is wholly improbable, since even Justin, thirty
years after, never quotes the New Testament writings as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>. The thing would be anomalous and opposed to
the history of the first half of the second century. When
these post-apostolic productions appeared, the New Testament
writings did not stand on the same level with the Old,
and were not yet esteemed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspired</span></em> like the Jewish
Scriptures. The Holy Spirit was thought to dwell in
all Christians, without being confined to a few writers; and
his influence was the common heritage of believers. There
are evidences of Barnabas's acquaintance with the Epistles
to the Romans and Corinthians; nor is it improbable that
he knew the canonical gospel of Matthew, though one passage
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appears</span></em> to contradict Matthew xxviii. 10, &amp;c., without
necessarily implying ignorance of what lies in it, viz., that

Justin Martyr (150 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) knew the first and third of the
synoptic gospels. His use of Mark's does not appear. His
knowledge of the fourth is denied by many, and zealously
defended by others. Thoma finds proofs that Justin knew
it well, and used it freely as a text-book of gnosis, without
recognizing it as the historical work of an apostle; an
hypothesis encumbered with difficulties.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> Whatever be said

proof; and this father's Logos-doctrine is less developed
than the Johannine, because it is encumbered with the notion

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

and though this tide is arbitrary at times, it is here irresistible.
Apologists should abstain from strong assertions on
a point so difficult, as that each <span class="tei tei-q">“gospel is distinctly recognized

of the Hebrews. This Petrine document may be referred

interpretation.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> He had also the older Acts of Pilate. Paul's
epistles are never mentioned, though he doubtless knew
them. Having little sympathy with Paulinism he attached
his belief much more to the primitive apostles. The Apocalypse,
1 Peter, and 1 John he esteemed highly; the epistle
to the Hebrews and the Acts he treated in the same way as
the Pauline writings. Justin's canon, as far as divine authority
and inspiration are concerned, was the Old Testament.
He was merely on the threshold of a divine canon
made up of primitive Christian writings, and attributed no
exclusive sanctity to those he used because they were not
to him the only source of doctrine. Even of the Apocalypse he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“A man among us
named John, &amp;c., wrote it.”</span><a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a>
In his time none of the gospels had been canonized, not
even the synoptists, if, indeed, he knew them all. Oral
tradition was the chief fountain of Christian knowledge, as
it had been for a century. In his opinion this tradition was
embodied in writing; but the documents in which he looked
for all that related to Christ were not the gospels alone.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He used others freely, not looking upon any as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspired</span></em>,
for that idea could arise only when a selection was made
among the current documents. He regarded them all as
having been written down from memory, and judged them
by criteria of evidence conformable to the Old Testament
Scriptures. Though lessons out of Gospels (some of our
present ones and others), as also out of the prophets, were read in assemblies
on the first day of the week,<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> the act of
converting the Christian writings into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em> was posterior;
for the mere reading of a gospel in churches on Sunday
does not prove that it was considered divinely authoritative;
and the use of the epistles, which formed the second and
less valued part of the collection, must still have been
limited.

The conception of a Catholic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canon</span></em> was realized about the
same time as that of a Catholic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">church</span></em>. One hundred and
seventy years from the coming of Christ elapsed before the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
raising the apostolic writings higher and higher till they
were of equal authority with the Old Testament, so that the
church might have a rule of appeal. But by lifting the
Christian productions up to the level of the old Jewish ones,
injury was done to that living consciousness which feels
the opposition between spirit and letter; the latter writings
tacitly assuming or keeping the character of a perfect rule
even as to form. The Old Testament was not brought
down to the New; the New was raised to the Old. It is
clear that the earliest church fathers did not use the books
of the New Testament as sacred documents clothed with
divine authority, but followed for the most part, at least till
the middle of the second century, apostolic tradition orally
transmitted. They were not solicitous about a canon circumscribed
within certain limits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second half, then, of the second century there was
a canon of the New Testament consisting of two parts called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the gospel</span></em><a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>

The first was complete, containing
the four gospels alone; the second, which was incomplete,
contained the Acts of the Apostles and epistles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
thirteen letters of Paul, one of Peter, one of John, and the
Revelation. How and where this canon originated is uncertain.
Its birthplace may have been Asia Minor, like
Marcion's; but it may have grown about the same time in
Asia Minor, Alexandria, and Western Africa. At all events,
Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian agree in
recognizing its existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Irenæus had a canon which he adopted as apostolic. In
his view it was of binding force and authoritative. This
contained the four gospels, the Acts, thirteen epistles of
Paul, the first epistle of John, and the Revelation. He had
also a sort of appendix or deutero-canon, which he highly
esteemed without putting it on a par with the received collection,
consisting of John's second epistle, the first of Peter,
and the Shepherd of Hermas. The last he calls
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a>

The epistle to the Hebrews, that of Jude, James's, second
Peter, and third John he ignored.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Clement's collection was more extended than Irenæus'.
His appendix or deutero-canon included the epistle to the
Hebrews, 2 John, Jude, the Apocalypse of Peter, the Shepherd
of Hermas, the Epistles of Clement and Barnabas. He
recognized no obligatory canon, distinct and of paramount
authority. But he separated the New Testament writings
by their traditionally apostolic character and the degree of
importance attached to them. He did not attach the modern
idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em> in opposition to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-canonical</span></em>, either to the
four gospels or any other part of the New Testament.
Barnabas is cited as an apostle.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> So is the Roman

line of the Homologoumena is not marked off even to the
same extent as in Irenæus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tertullian's canon consisted of the gospels, Acts, thirteen
epistles of Paul, the Apocalypse, and 1 John. As an appendix
he had the epistle to the Hebrews, that of Jude, the
Shepherd of Hermas, 2 John probably, and 1 Peter. This
deutero-canon was not regarded as authoritative. No trace
occurs in his works of James' epistle, 2 Peter, and 3 John. He used the Shepherd,
calling it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>,<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> without implying,
however, that he put it on a par with the usually acknowledged
canonical writings; but after he became a
Montanist, he repudiated it as the apocryphal Shepherd of
adulterers, <span class="tei tei-q">“put among the apocryphal and false, by every
council of the churches.”</span><a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> It was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>, however, reckoned
among the spurious and false writings, either at Rome or
Carthage, in the time of Tertullian. It was merely placed
outside the universally received works by the western
churches of that day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These three fathers did not fix the canon absolutely. Its
limits were still unsettled. But they sanctioned most of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
books now accepted as divine, putting some extra-canonical
productions almost on the same level with the rest, if not in
theory, at least in practice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The canon of Muratori is a fragmentary list which was
made towards the end of the second century (170 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>).
Its birthplace is uncertain, though there are traces of
Roman origin. Its translation from the Greek is assumed,
but that is uncertain. It begins with the four gospels in
the usual order, and proceeds to the Acts, thirteen epistles
of Paul, the epistles of John, that of Jude, and the Apocalypse.
The epistle to the Hebrews, 1 and 2 Peter, 1 John
and James are not named. The Apocalypse of Peter is also
mentioned, but as not universally received. Of the Shepherd
of Hermas, it is stated that it may be read in the
Church. The epistle <span class="tei tei-q">“to the Laodiceans”</span> may either be
that to the Ephesians, which had such superscription in
Marcion's canon, or less probably the supposititious epistle
mentioned in the codex Boernerianus,<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> after that to Philemon,
and often referred to in the middle ages.<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> That <span class="tei tei-q">“to
the Alexandrians”</span> is probably the epistle to the Hebrews;
though this has been denied without sufficient reason. According
to the usual punctuation, both are said to have been
forged in Paul's name, an opinion which may have been
entertained among Roman Christians about 170 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> The
Epistle to the Hebrews was rejected in the west, and may
have been thought a supposititious work in the interests of Paulinism, with some
reason because of its internal character,<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>
which is at least semi-Pauline, though its Judaistic
basis is apparent. The story about the origin of the fourth
gospel with its apostolic and episcopal attestation, evinces
a desire to establish the authenticity of a work which had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not obtained universal acceptance at the time.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> It is difficult
to make out the meaning in various places; and there
is considerable diversity of opinion among expositors of the
document.<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> In accord with these facts we
find Serapion bishop of the church at Rhossus, in Cilicia,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> allowing the

was no exclusive gospel-canon at the end of the second century,
at least in Syria. The present canon had not then
pervaded the churches in general.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is the result of an examination of the Christian
literature belonging to the second century? Is it that a
canon was then fixed, separating some books from others
by a line so clear, that those on one side of it were alone
reckoned inspired, authoritative, of apostolic origin or sanction;
while those on the other were considered uninspired,
unauthoritative, without claim to apostolicity, unauthentic?
Was the separation between them made on any clear principle
or demarcation? It cannot be said so. The century
witnessed no such fact, but merely the incipient efforts to
bring it about. The discriminating process was begun, not
completed. It was partly forced upon the prominent advocates
of a policy which sought to consolidate the Jewish and
Gentile-Christian parties, after the decline of their mutual
antagonism, into a united church. They were glad to
transfer the current belief in the infallible inspiration of the
Old Testament, to selected Christian writings, as an effective
means of defence against those whom they considered outside
a new organization—the Catholic Church.

peculiar. After the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,
and the historical books, follow Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
Canticles, Wisdom, Sirach, the twelve minor prophets,
the four greater; three books of the Maccabees, Judith,
Esdras, Esther, Job, and Tobit. In the New Testament,
the four gospels, Matthew, John, Mark, Luke, are succeeded
by ten epistles of Paul, two of Peter, the epistle of James,
three of John, and that of Jude. The epistle to the Hebrews
(characterized as that of Barnabas), the Revelation of John,
Acts of the Apostles, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Acts of
Paul, the Revelation of Peter, follow. The last three constitute
a sort of appendix; and the number of their verses
is given. It is possible that the carelessness of a transcriber
may have caused some of the singularities observable in this
list; such as the omission of the epistles to the Philippians
and Thessalonians; but the end shows a freer idea of books
fit for reading than what was usual even at that early time

In Syria a version of the New Testament for the use of
the church was made early in the third century. This work,
commonly called the Peshito, wants 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John,
Jude, and the Apocalypse. It has, however, all the other
books, including the epistle of James and that to the Hebrews.
The last two were received as apostolic.

Towards the middle of the third century, Origen's<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> testimony
respecting the Canon is of great value. He seems to
have distinguished three classes of books—authentic ones,
whose apostolic origin was generally admitted, those not authentic,
and a middle-class not generally recognized or in regard
to which his own opinion wavered. The first contained
those already adopted at the beginning of the century both
in the East and West, with the Apocalypse, and the epistle

application admitted of considerable latitude, he is cautious
enough, appealing to the tradition of the church, and throwing
in qualifying expressions.<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>

corresponding to Origen's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mixed</span></em><a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intermediate</span></em> writings,
the second to his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spurious</span></em><a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a>
ones. The former subdivision
contains the epistle of James, 2 Peter, Jude, 2 and 3 John;
the latter, the Acts of Paul, the Shepherd, the Revelation of
Peter, the epistle of Barnabas, the Doctrines of the Apostles,
the Apocalypse of John, the gospel according to the Hebrews.
The third class has the gospels of Peter, of Thomas, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
traditions of Matthias, the Acts of Peter, Andrew, and John.
The subdivisions of the second class are indefinite. The
only distinction which Eusebius puts between them is that
of ecclesiastical use. Though he classes as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spurious</span></em> the
Acts of Paul, the Shepherd, the Revelation of Peter, the
epistle of Barnabas, the doctrines of the Apostles, the Apocalypse
of John, the gospel according to the Hebrews, and
does not apply the epithet to the epistle of James, the 2 of
Peter, 2 and 3 John; he uses of James's in one place the
verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to be counted spurious</span></em>.<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> In like manner he speaks of the Apocalypse of Peter and the epistle of
Barnabas as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">controverted</span></em>.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mixed</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spurious</span></em> of Origen are vaguely
separated by Eusebius; both come under the general head
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">controverted</span></em>; for after specifying them separately he
sums up, <span class="tei tei-q">“all these will belong to the class of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">controverted</span></em>,”</span>
the very class already described as containing
<span class="tei tei-q">“books well known and recognized by most,”</span> implying also
that they were read in the churches.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is somewhat remarkable that Eusebius does not mention
the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians in this list.
But he speaks of it in another place as a production whose
authenticity was generally acknowledged,<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> and of its public
use in most churches both formerly and in his own time.
This wide-spread reading of it did not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> imply
canonicity; but the mode in which Eusebius characterizes
it, and its extensive use in public, favor the idea that in
many churches it was almost put on equality with the productions
commonly regarded as authoritative. The canonical
list was not fixed immovably in the time of Eusebius.
Opinions about books varied, as they had done before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The testimony of Eusebius regarding the canon, important
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as it is, has less weight because of the historian's
credulity. One who believed in the authenticity of Abgar's
letters to Christ, and in the canon of the four gospels at the
time of Trajan, cannot take rank as a judicious collector or
sifter of facts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About 332 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> the Emperor Constantine entrusted
Eusebius with the commission to make out a complete collection
of the sacred Christian writings for the use of the
Catholic Church. How this order was executed we are not
told. But Credner is probably correct in saying that the
code consisted of all that is now in the New Testament
except the Revelation. The fifty copies which were made
must have supplied Constantinople and the Greek Church
for a considerable time with an authoritative canon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eusebius's catalogue agrees in substance with that of
Origen's. The historian followed ecclesiastical tradition.
He inquired diligently into the prevailing opinions of the
Christian churches and writers, with the views held by
others before and contemporaneously with himself, but
could not attain to a decided result. His hesitation stood
in the way of a clear, firm, view of the question. The tradition
respecting certain books was still wavering, and he
was unable to fix it. Authority fettered his independent
judgment. That he was inconsistent and confused does
not need to be shown.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The exact principles that guided the formation of a canon
in the earliest centuries cannot be discovered. Strictly
speaking there were none. Definite grounds for the reception
or rejection of books were not apprehended. The
choice was determined by various circumstances, of which
apostolic origin was the chief, though this itself was
insufficiently attested; for if it be asked whether all the New
Testament writings proceeded from the authors whose
names they bear, criticism cannot reply in the affirmative.
The example and influence of churches to which the writings
had been first addressed must have acted upon the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reception of books. Above all, individual teachers here and
there saw the necessity of meeting heretics with their own
weapons, in their own way, with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apostolic records</span></em> instead of
oral tradition. The circumstances in which the orthodox
were placed led to this step, effecting a bond of union whose
need must have been felt while each church was isolated
under its own bishop and the collective body could not take
measures in common. Writings of more recent origin would
be received with greater facility than such as had been in circulation
for many years, especially if they professed to come
from a prominent apostle. A code of apostolic writings, divine
and perfect like the Old Testament, had to be presented
as soon as possible against Gnostic and Manichæan heretics
whose doctrines were injurious to objective Christianity;
while the multiplication of apocryphal works threatened to
overwhelm genuine tradition with a heap of superstition.
The Petrine and Pauline Christians, now amalgamated to a
great extent, agreed in hastening the canon-process.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The infancy of the canon was cradled in an uncritical
age, and rocked with traditional ease. Conscientious care
was not directed from the first to the well-authenticated
testimony of eye-witnesses. Of the three fathers who contributed
most to its early growth, Irenæus was credulous
and blundering; Tertullian passionate and one-sided; and
Clement of Alexandria, imbued with the treasures of Greek
wisdom, was mainly occupied with ecclesiastical ethics.
Irenæus argues that the gospels should be four in number,
neither more nor less, because there are four universal winds
and four quarters of the world. The Word or Architect of
all things gave the gospel in a fourfold shape. According
to this father, the apostles were fully informed concerning
all things, and had a perfect knowledge, after their Lord's
ascension. Matthew wrote his gospel while Peter and Paul were preaching
in Rome and founding the church.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> Such

The three fathers of whom we are speaking, had neither
the ability nor the inclination to examine the genesis of
documents surrounded with an apostolic halo. No analysis
of their authenticity and genuineness was seriously attempted
either by them or by the men of their time. In its
absence, custom, accident, taste, practical needs directed the
tendency of tradition. All the rhetoric employed to throw
the value of their testimony as far back as possible, even
up to or at least very near the apostle John is of the vaguest
sort. Appeals to the continuity of tradition and of church
doctrine, to the exceptional veneration of these fathers for
the gospels, to their opinions being formed earlier than the
composition of the works in which they are expressed, possess
no force. The ends which the fathers in question had
in view, their polemic motives, their uncritical, inconsistent
assertions, their want of sure data, detract from their testimony.
Their decisions were much more the result of pious
feeling biased by the theological speculations of the times,
than the conclusions of a sound judgment. The very arguments
they use to establish certain conclusions show weakness
of perception. What are the manifestations of spiritual
feeling, compared with the results of logical reasoning?
Are they more trustworthy than the latter? Certainly not,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at least in relation to questions of evidence. It is true that
their testimony has a value; but it is one proportionate to
the degree of credibility attaching to witnesses circumstanced
as they were, whose separation of canonical from
uncanonical gospels, or rather their canonizing of certain
writings apart from others, and their claiming of inspiration
for the authors of the former, must be judged by the reasonableness
of the thing itself, in connection with men of their
type. The second century abounded in pseudonymous
literature; and the early fathers, as well as the churches,
were occupied with other things than the sifting of evidence
connected with writings considerably prior to their own
time. The increase of such apocryphal productions, gospels,
acts, and apocalypses among the heretical parties stimulated
the orthodox bishops and churches to make an authentic
collection; but it increased the difficulties of the task.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Textual criticism has been employed to discredit the true
dates of the present gospels; and the most exaggerated descriptions
have been given of the frequent transcription of
the text and its great corruption in the second century.
The process of corruption in the course of frequent transcription
has been transferred even to the first century. It
is true that the gospels at the end of that century exhibited
a text which bears marks of transcription, interpolation,
and addition; but they were not the complete works as we
have them now, being then but in progress, except the
fourth. The assumption that <span class="tei tei-q">“advanced corruption”</span> existed
in the present text of the synoptists as early as the
first century is gratuitous; unless the process by which
they were gradually built up is so called. No attempt to
get a long history behind the canonical gospels at the close
of the first century out of <span class="tei tei-q">“advanced corruption”</span> can be
successful. It is attested by no Christian writer of the
century; and those in the first half of the second, both heretical
and orthodox, did themselves treat the text in a
manner far short of its implied infallibility. The various
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
readings with which they had to do, do not carry up <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the canonical
gospels</span></em> far into the first century. The transcription,
enlargement, and interpolation of the materials which make
up the body of them, must not be identified with the corruption
of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">completed texts</span></em>, in order that the latter may be
relegated to an early period; for the synoptists did not
come forth full-blown, each from the hand of a single person.
The old Latin version or versions used by Tertullian and
the interpreter of Irenæus, have been pressed into the same
service, but in vain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner the Curetonian Syriac version of the gospels
has been put as early as possible into the second
century, though it can hardly have been prior to the very
close of it, or rather to the beginning of the third. Here
the strong assertions of apologetic writers have been freely
scattered abroad. But the evidence in favor of the authors
traditionally assigned to the gospels and some of the epistles,
is still uncertain. A wide gap intervenes between eye-witnesses
of the apostles or apostolic men that wrote the sacred
books, and the earliest fathers who assert such authorship.
The traditional bridge between them is a precarious one. As
the chasm cannot be filled by adequate external evidence,
we are thrown back on the internal character of the works
themselves. One thing appears from the early corruption
of the sacred records spoken of by Irenæus, Origen, and
others, that they were not regarded with the veneration
necessarily attaching to infallible documents. Their being
freely handled excludes the idea of rigid canonization. The
men who first canonized them had no certain knowledge of
their authors. To them, that knowledge had been obscured
or lost; though a sagacious criticism might have arrived at
the true state of the question even in their day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the sub-apostolic age Ebionitism passed into Catholicism,
Jewish into Pauline Christianity, the mythical and
marvelous into the dogmatic, the traditional into the historic,
the legendary into the literary. The conflict of parties
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
within the sphere of Christianity gave rise to productions
of various tendencies which reflected the circumstances out
of which they arose. These were accepted or rejected by
the churches according to the prevailing opinions of the
persons composing the churches. Common usage led to
the authorization of some; others were neglected. The
state of the second century in its beliefs, credulity, idiosyncracies
of prominent teachers, antagonistic opinions and
mystic speculations, throws a light upon the New Testament
writings and especially on the formation of the canon, which
explains their genesis. Two things stand out most clearly,
the comparatively late idea of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em> New Testament
literature; and the absence of critical principles in determining
it. The former was not entertained till the latter part
of the second century. The conception of canonicity and
inspiration attaching to New Testament books did not exist
till the time of Irenæus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When it is asked, to whom do we owe the canon? the
usual answer is, to the Church. This is true only in a
sense. The unity attributed to Christians before Irenæus
and Tertullian, consisted in their religious consciousness.
It was subjective. The idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the church</span></em> was that of inward
fellowship—the fellowship of the spirit rather than an
outward organism. The preservation of the early Christian
writings was owing, in the first instance, to the congregations
to whom they were sent, and the neighboring ones
with whom such congregations had friendly connection.
The care of them devolved on the most influential teachers,—on
those who occupied leading positions in the chief
cities, or were most interested in apostolic writings as a
source of instruction. The Christian books were mostly in
the hands of the bishops. In process of time the canon was
the care of assemblies or councils. But it had been made
before the first general council by a few leading fathers towards
the end of the second century in different countries.
The formation of a Catholic Church and of a canon was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
simultaneous. The circumstances in which the collection
originated were unfavorable to the authenticity of its materials,
for tradition had been busy over them and their
authors. Instead of attributing the formation of the canon
to the Church, it would be more correct to say that the
important stage in it was due to three teachers, each working
separately and in his own way, who were intent upon
the creation of a Christian society which did not appear in
the apostolic age,—a visible organization united in faith,—where
the discordant opinions of apostolic and sub-apostolic
times should be finally merged. The canon was not the
work of the Christian Church so much as of the men who
were striving to form that Church, and could not get beyond
the mould received by primitive Christian literature.
The first mention of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Catholic Church</span></em> occurs in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
Martyrdom of Polycarp</span></span>, an epistle that cannot be dated earlier than
160 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, and may perhaps be ten years later. But though
the idea is there, its established use is due to Irenæus, Tertullian,
and Cyprian. The expression has a different and
narrow sense in the seven Ignatian epistles which we believe
to be supposititious and later than Justin. Neither the
three epistles published in Syriac by Cureton, nor the seven
Greek ones enumerated by Eusebius are authentic; though
Zahn has tried to prove the latter such, dating them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
144. His arguments, however, are far from convincing;
and the whole story of<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> Ignatius's martyrdom at Rome
rather than Antioch is still doubtful; for the circumstances
under which he is said to have been dragged to Rome, and
his writing letters to the churches by the way, are highly
improbable. The testimony of Malalas that Ignatius suffered
at Antioch in December, 115, in the presence of Trajan,
may be quite as good as that of Chrysostom and the Syriac
monthly calendar on which Zahn relies so confidently. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fact of the priority of the last two to Malalas is of little
weight as evidence. The main point is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the locality</span></em> in which
Ignatius suffered; which Malalas, himself a native of Antioch
and a historian, ought to have known better than
Chrysostom, because he copied preceding historians.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is necessary to be precise on this subject because some
speak of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the church</span></em> as though it were contemporary with
the apostles themselves, or at least with their immediate
disciples; and proceed to argue that dissensions arose soon
after <span class="tei tei-q">“within the church”</span> rendering an appeal to the written
word necessary. When the authority of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">traditional
teaching</span></em> gave way to that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a written rule</span></em>, a change came
over the condition of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the church</span></em>. Such a view tends to mislead.
There were dissensions among the earliest Christians.
The apostles themselves were by no means unanimous.
Important differences of belief divided the Jewish and Gentile
Christians from the beginning. The types of Christian
truth existing from the first gradually coalesced about the
middle of the second century; when heretics, especially the
Gnostics, appeared so formidable that a catholic church was
developed. Along with this process, and as an important
element in it, the writings of apostles and apostolic men
were uncritically taken from tradition and elevated to the
rank of divine documents. It was not the rise of new dissensions
<span class="tei tei-q">“within the church”</span> which led to the first formation
of a Christian canon; rather did the new idea of <span class="tei tei-q">“a
catholic church”</span> require a standard of appeal in apostolic
writings, which were now invested with an authority that
did not belong to them from the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Origen was the first who took a somewhat scientific view
of the relative value belonging to the different parts of the
biblical collection. His examination of the canon was
critical. Before him the leading books had been regarded
as divine and sacred, the source of doctrinal and historic
truth. From this stand-point he did not depart. With him
ecclesiastical tradition was a prevailing principle in the recognition
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of books belonging of right to the New Testament
collection. He was also guided by the inspiration of the
authors; a criterion arbitrary in its application, as his own
statements show. In his time, however, the collection was
being gradually enlarged; his third class. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the mixed</span></em>,
approaching reception into the first. But amid all the fluctuations
of opinion to which certain portions of the New
Testament were subject, and the unscientific procedure both
of fathers and churches in the matter, though councils had
not met to discuss it, and vague tradition had strengthened
with time, a certain spiritual consciousness manifested itself
throughout the East and West in the matter of the
canon. Tolerable unanimity ensued. The result was a
remarkable one, and calls for our gratitude, notwithstanding
its defects. Though the development was pervaded by no
critical or definite principle, it ended in a canon which has
maintained its validity for centuries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is sometimes said that the history of the canon should
be sought from definite catalogues, not from isolated quotations.
The latter are supposed to be of slight value, the
former to be the result of deliberate judgment. This remark
is more specious than solid. In relation to the Old
Testament, the catalogues given by the fathers, as by Melito
and Origen, rest solely on the tradition of the Jews; apart
from which they have no independent authority. As none
except Jerome and Origen knew Hebrew, their lists of the
Old Testament books are simply a reflection of what they
learned from others. If they deviate in practice from their
masters by quoting as Scripture other than the canonical
books, they show their judgment over-riding an external
theory. The very men who give a list of the Jewish books
evince an inclination to the Christian and enlarged canon.
So Origen says, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to Africanus</span></span>, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
churches use Tobit.”</span> In explaining the prophet Isaiah,
Jerome employs Sirach vi. 6, in proof of his view, remarking
that the apocryphal work is in the Christian catalogue.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner Epiphanius, in a passage against Aetius,
after referring to the books of Scripture, adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“as well as
the books of Wisdom, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Wisdom of Solomon and of
Jesus, son of Sirach; finally, all the other books of Scripture.”</span>
In another place he gives the canon of the Jews
historically, and excludes the apocryphal Greek books; here
he includes some of the latter. We also learn from Jerome
that Judith was in the number of the books reckoned up by
the Nicene Council. Thus the fathers who give catalogues
of the Old Testament show the existence of a Jewish and a
Christian canon in relation to the Old Testament; the latter
wider than the former; their private opinion being more
favorable to the one, though the other was historically
transmitted. In relation to the New Testament, the synods
which drew up lists of the sacred books show the view of
some leading father like Augustine, along with what custom
had sanctioned. In this department no member of the
synod exercised his critical faculty; a number together
would decide such questions summarily. Bishops proceed
in the track of tradition or authority.

together, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the canon of the Bible</span></em>. The canons
of both have been considered separately to the end of the third
century; they may be henceforward discussed together.
We proceed, therefore, to the Bible-canon of the fourth
century, first in the Greek Church and then in the Latin.
The Council of Laodicea (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 363), at which there was a
predominant semiarian influence, forbad the reading of all
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-canonical</span></em> books. The 59th canon enacts, that <span class="tei tei-q">“private
psalms must not be read in the Church, nor uncanonized
books; but only the canonical ones of the New and Old
Testament.”</span> The 60th canon proceeds to give a list of
such. All the books of the Old Testament are enumerated,
but in a peculiar order, somewhat like the Septuagint one.
With Jeremiah is specified <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Baruch</span></span>, then the Lamentations
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle</span></span>. The prophets are last; first the minor, next
the major and Daniel. In the New Testament list are the
usual seven Catholic epistles, and fourteen of Paul, including
that to the Hebrews. The Apocalypse alone is wanting.
Credner has proved that this 60th canon is not original, and
of much later date.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>

The progress made by the Greek Church of the fourth
and former part of the fifth century, in its conception of
the canon seems to be, that the idea of ecclesiastical settlement,
or public, legal, definitive establishment was attached
to the original one. A writing was considered canonical
when a well-attested tradition put it among those composed
by inspired men, apostles or others; and it had on that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account a determining authority in matters of faith. Books
which served as a rule of faith and were definitively set
forth by the Church as divinely authoritative, were now
termed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em>. The canon consisted of writings settled
or determined by ecclesiastical law.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> Such was the idea
added to the original acceptation of canon. To canonical
were opposed apocryphal writings, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heretical</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fabricated</span></em>
ones; while an intermediate class consisted of those
read in the churches, which were useful, but not decisive in
matters of belief. Another advance in the matter of the
canon at this period was the general adoption of the Hebrew
canon, with a relegation of the Greek additions in the Septuagint
to the class <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">publicly read</span></em>.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> Yet doubts about the
reception of Esther into the number of the canonical books
were still entertained, though it was one of the Jewish
canon; doubtless on account of its want of harmony with
Christian consciousness. And the catholic epistles which
had been doubted before, Jude, James, Second Peter, were
now generally received. But there was a division of opinion
about the Apocalypse.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We come to the period of the Latin, corresponding to that
of the Greek Church which has just been noticed. Augustine<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>
gave great attention to the subject, laboring to establish
a complete canon, the necessity of which was generally
felt. According to him the Scriptures which were received
and acknowledged by all the churches of the day should be
canonical. Of those not universally adopted, such as are
received by the majority and the weightier of the churches
should be preferred to those received by the fewer and less
important churches. In his enumeration of the forty-four
books of the Old Testament, he gives, after Chronicles,
other histories <span class="tei tei-q">“which are neither connected with the order”</span>
specified in the preceding context, <span class="tei tei-q">“nor with one another,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Job, Tobit, Esther, Judith, the two books of the Maccabees,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Esdras. Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, he thinks,
should be numbered among the prophets, as deserving of
authority and having a certain likeness to Solomon's writings.<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a>
He says of the Maccabees that this <span class="tei tei-q">“Scripture has
been received by the Church not uselessly, if it be read or
heard soberly.”</span><a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a>
The famous passage in the treatise on
Christian doctrine, where he enumerates the whole canon,
is qualified by no other; for though he knew the distinction
between the canonical books of the Palestinian Jews and
the so-called apocryphal ones, as well as the fact of some
New Testament writings not being received universally, he
thought <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">church-reception</span></em> a sufficient warrant for canonical
authority. Hence, he considered the books of the Maccabees
canonical, because so received by the Church; while
he says of Wisdom and Sirach that they merited <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authoritative</span></em>
reception and numbering among the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic</span></em>
Scriptures.<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a>
Of the former in particular he speaks strongly in one place,
asserting that it is worthy to be venerated by all Christians
as of divine authority.<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> But he afterwards retracted his opinion of
the canonical authority of Sirach.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a> He raises,
not lowers, the authority of the so-called apocryphal books
which he mentions. He enumerates all the New Testament
books, specifying the Pauline epistles as fourteen, and so
reckoning that to the Hebrews as the apostle's; but he
speaks of it elsewhere as an epistle about which some were
uncertain, professing that he was influenced to admit it as canonical by the
authority of the Oriental churches.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> In

gives a list of the twenty-two canonical books of
the Old Testament, the same as that of the Palestinian Jews,
remarking that some put Ruth and Lamentations among
the Hagiographa, so making twenty-four books. All besides
should be put among the Apocrypha. Wisdom, Sirach,
Judith, Tobit, the Shepherd are not in the canon. The two books of Maccabees
he regarded in the same light.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> But

books”</span> of Athanasius. His idea of <span class="tei tei-q">“apocryphal”</span> is
wider and milder than that of some others in the Latin
Church. It has been conjectured by Welte,<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>
that the conclusions
of the African councils in 393 and 397 influenced

to the apocryphal works in a more favorable manner than

Jerome differed from his theory; or rather he became less
positive, and altered his views somewhat with the progress

a catalogue of all that now belongs to it, remarking of the

both on the authority of ancient writers, not of present custom.

A canonical list appears in three different forms bearing

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Old Testament are arranged in three orders. In the

two Chronicles, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,
Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus; in the second, all the prophets,
including Baruch; in the third, Job, Tobit, Judith, Esther,

four gospels, fourteen epistles of Paul, the Apocalypse, and
Acts, with seven Catholic epistles.

The preceding notices and catalogues show a general desire
in the Western Church to settle the canon. The two
most influential men of the period were Augustine and
Jerome, who did not entirely agree. Both were unfitted for
a critical examination of the topic. The former was a
gifted spiritual man, lacking learning and independence.
Tradition dominated all his ideas about the difficult or disputed
books. He did not enter upon the question scientifically,
on the basis of certain principles; but was content
to take refuge in authority—the prevailing authority of
leading churches. His judgment was weak, his sagacity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moderate, and his want of many-sidedness hindered a critical
result. Jerome, again, was learned but timid, lacking
the courage to face the question fairly or fundamentally;
and the independence necessary to its right investigation.
Belonging as he did to both churches, he recommended the
practice of the one to the other. He, too, was chiefly influenced
by tradition; by Jewish teachers in respect to the
Old Testament, and by general custom as to the New. The
question was not susceptible of advancement under such
manipulation; nor could it be settled on a legitimate basis.
Compared with the eastern Church, the western accepted a
wider canon of the Old Testament, taking some books into
the class of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em> which the former put among those
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to be read</span></em>. In regard to the New Testament, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the Catholic
epistles and even the Apocalypse were received. The
African churches and councils generally adopted this larger
canon, because the old Latin version or versions of the
Bible current in Africa were daughters of the Septuagint.
If the Latins apparently looked upon the Greek as the
original itself, the apocryphal books would soon get rank
with the canonical. Yet the more learned fathers, Jerome,
Rufinus and others, favored the Hebrew canon in distinguishing
between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiastical</span></em> books. The
influence of the Eastern upon the Western Church is still
visible, though it could not extinguish the prevailing desire
to include the disputed books. The Greek view was
to receive nothing which had not apparently a good attestation
of divine origin and apostolic authority; the Latin was
to exclude nothing hallowed by descent and proved by
custom. The former Church looked more to the sources of
doctrine; the latter to those of edification. The one desired
to contract those sources, so as not to be too rich; the other
to enlarge the springs of edification, not to be too poor.
Neither had the proper resources for the work, nor a right
perception of the way in which it should be set about; and
therefore they were not fortunate in their conclusions, differing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as they did in regard to points which affect the
foundation of a satisfactory solution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding the numerous endeavors both in the
East and West to settle the canon during the 4th and 5th
centuries, it was not finally closed. The doubts of individuals
were still expressed; and succeeding ages testified to
the want of universal agreement respecting several books.
The question, however, was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practically</span></em> determined. No
material change occurred again in the absolute rejection or
admission of books. With some fluctuations, the canon
remained very much as it was in the 4th and 5th centuries.
Tradition shaped and established its character. General
usage gave it a permanency which it was not easy to disturb.
No definite principles guided the course of its formation,
or fixed its present state. It was dominated first
and last by circumstances and ideas which philosophy did
not actuate. Its history is mainly objective. Uncritical at
its commencement, it was equally so in the two centuries
which have just been considered.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The history of the canon in the Syrian church cannot be
traced with much exactness. The Peshito version had only
the Hebrew canonical books at first; most of the apocryphal
were rendered from the Greek and added in the Nestorian
recension. In the New Testament it wanted four of the
catholic epistles and the Apocalypse. Ephrem (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 378)
uses all the books in our canon, the apocryphal as well as
the canonical. The former are cited by him in the same
way as the latter. Sirach ii. 1 is quoted with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as the Scripture
says</span></em>;<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> and Wisdom iv. 7 with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is

xiii. 9, belonging to the Greek additions, is also cited with
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as it is written</span></em>.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> It should be observed that the quotations
given are all from Ephrem's Greek, not Syriac, works; and
that suspicions have been raised about the former being
tampered with. The Syrian version of the New Testament
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made by Polycarp at the request of Philoxenus of Mabug,
had the four catholic epistles wanting in the Peshito. It
had also the two epistles of Clement to the Corinthians, if
we may judge by the Harclean recension, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616; for a
MS. in the Cambridge University Library contains those
epistles immediately after the Catholic ones, and before
those of St. Paul; so that they are put on an equality
with the canonical writings. The Apocalypse is wanting.
Junilius, (though an African bishop about 550 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), says
that he got his knowledge from a Persian of the name of
Paulus who received his education in the school of Nisibis.
He may, therefore, be considered a witness of the opinions
of the Syrian church at the beginning of the 6th century.
Dividing the biblical books into those of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em>, those of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intermediate</span></em>, and those of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no authority</span></em>, he makes the first
the canonical; the second, those added to them by many
(plures); the third, all the rest. In the first list he puts
Ecclesiasticus. Among the second he puts 1 and 2 Chronicles,
Job, Ezra and Nehemiah, Judith, Esther, 1 and 2
Maccabees; and in the New Testament, James, 2 Peter,
Jude, 2 and 3 John. He also says that the Apocalypse of
John is much doubted by the Orientals. In the third list
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, books of no authority added by some (quidam) to the
canonical, are put Wisdom and Canticles.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> The catalogue
is confused, and erroneous at least in one respect, that
Jerome is referred to, as sanctioning the division given of
the Old Testament books; for neither he nor the Jews
agree with it.

The canon of the Abyssinian church seems to have had
at first all the books in the Septuagint, canonical and apocryphal
together, little distinction being made between them.
Along with the contents of the Greek Bible there were
Enoch, 4 Esdras, the Ascension of Isaiah, the Jubilees, Asseneth,
&amp;c. That of the New Testament agrees with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

list was made and constituted the legal one for the use of
the church, having been derived from the Jacobite canons
of the apostles. This gives, in the Old Testament, the
Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Judith, Kings, Chronicles,
Ezra and Nehemiah, Esther, Tobit, two books of Maccabees,
Job, Psalms, five books of Solomon, minor and
greater prophets. The Wisdom of Sirach (for teaching
children) and the book of Joseph ben Gorion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that of

four gospels, Acts, seven apostolic epistles, fourteen of
Paul, and the Revelation of John. Later catalogues vary
much, and are often enlarged with the book of Enoch, 4

The canon of the Armenians had at first the Palestinian
books of the Old Testament, twenty-two in number, and
the usual New Testament ones, except the Apocalypse. It
was made from the Syriac in the fifth century by Sahak

were appended, after the disciples of those two men who
had been sent by them into different places, brought back
authentic copies of the Greek Bible from the patriarch
Maximian, by which the version already made was interpolated
and corrected; as it was subsequently corrected by
others despatched to Alexandria and Athens, who, however,
did not return till their teachers were dead. The MSS. of

the fourth book of Esdras, the prayer of Manasseh, the
Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul and his answer, the Rest
(end) of the apostle and evangelist John, the prayer of
Euthalius. Like the edition of Oskan, this has all the
deutero-canonical books, which were derived from the Septuagint,
and incorporated by the first translators with their
original version. Another edition published at St. Petersburgh
(1817), for the use of the Jacobite Church, has the
prayer of Manasses and 4 Esdras after the Apocalypse.

The Georgian version consisted of the books and additions
in the Greek translation from which it was made.
The New Testament has the canonical books in the usual
order. Jesus Sirach and two books of the Maccabees (2d
and 3d) were not in the Georgian MS. used by Prince Arcil
for the edition of 1743, but were rendered out of the
Russian. The Moscow Bible printed under the direction
and at the cost of Arcil, Bacchar and Wakuset, is the authorized

The Bible canon of the Eastern church in the middle
ages shows no real advance. Endeavors were made to remove
the uncertainty arising from the existence of numerous
lists; but former decisions and decrees of councils were
repeated instead of a new, independent canon. Here belongs
the catalogue in the Alexandrian MS., of the fifth century,
which is peculiar. After the prophets come Esther, Tobit,
Judith, Ezra and Nehemiah, 4 Maccabees, Psalms, Job,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, the all-virtuous Wisdom,
the Wisdom of Jesus of Sirach. In the New Testament,
the Apocalypse is followed by two epistles of Clement.
The list was probably made in Egypt. That of Anastasius
Sinaita,<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>
patriarch of Antioch, is similar to Nicephorus's
Stichometry, which we shall mention afterwards. Baruch
is among the canonical books; Esther among the antilegomena.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Apocalypse is unnoticed. The 85th of the
Apostolic canons gives a list of the Old and New Testament
books, in which the usual canonical ones of the former are
supplemented by Judith and 3 Maccabees; those of the
latter by the two epistles of Clement, with the Apostolic
constitutions. This catalogue cannot be put earlier than
the fifth or sixth century, and is subject to the suspicion of
having been interpolated. We have also Nicephorus's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stichometry</span></span> (806-815;)<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> of which we may remark that Baruch
is among the canonical books of the Old Testament; while
the Revelation is put with the Apocalypse of Peter, the
epistle of Barnabas and the Gospel according to the Hebrews,
among the antilegomena of the New Testament. It
is also surprising that the Apocalypse of Peter and the
Gospel according to the Hebrews are not among the Apocrypha,
where Clement's epistles with the productions of
Ignatius, Polycarp, and Hermas appear. The list is probably
older than that of the Antioch patriarch Anastasius
Sinaita. Cosmas Indicopleustes (535) never mentions the
seven Catholic epistles of the New Testament or the Apocalypse.
The Trullan council (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 692) adopts the eighty-five
Apostolic canons, rejecting, however, the Apostolic
Constitutions. Photius, patriarch of Constantinople,<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> follows

In the Western church of the Middle Ages, diversity of
opinion respecting certain books continued. Though the
views of Augustine were generally followed, the stricter
ones of Jerome found many adherents. The canon was
fluctuating, and the practice of the churches in regard to it
somewhat lax. Here belong Cassiodorus (about 550); the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Reformers generally returned to the Hebrew canon,
dividing off the additional books of the Septuagint or those
attached to the Vulgate. These they called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apocryphal</span></em>,
after Jerome's example. Though considered of no authority
in matters of doctrine, they were pronounced useful and
edifying. The principal reason that weighed with the Reformers
was, that Christ and the apostles testified to none
of the Septuagint additions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the canonical books of the Old Testament, Luther
translated Judith, Wisdom, Tobit, Sirach, Baruch, 1 and 2
Maccabees, the Greek additions to Esther and Daniel, with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Prayer of Manasseh. His judgment respecting several
of these is expressed in the prefaces to them. With regard
to 1 Maccabees, he thinks it almost equal to the other books
of Holy Scripture, and not unworthy to be reckoned among
them. Of Wisdom, he says, he was long in doubt whether
it should be numbered among the canonical books; and of
Sirach that it is a right good book proceeding from a wise
man. But he speaks unfavorably of several other apocryphal
productions, as of Baruch and 2 Maccabees. It is
evident, however, that he considered all he translated of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> use to the Christian Church. He thought that the
book of Esther should not belong to the canon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Luther's judgment respecting some of the New Testament
books was freer than most Protestants now are disposed
to approve. He thought the epistle to the Hebrews
was neither Paul's nor an apostle's, but proceeded from an
excellent and learned man who may have been the disciple
of apostles. He did not put it on an equality with the
epistles written by apostles themselves. The Apocalypse
he considered neither apostolic nor prophetic, but put it almost
on the same level with the 4th book of Esdras, which
he spoke elsewhere of tossing into the Elbe. This judgment
was afterwards modified, not retracted. James's epistle
he pronounced unapostolic, <span class="tei tei-q">“a right strawy epistle.”</span>
In like manner, he did not believe that Jude's epistle proceeded
from an apostle. Considering it to have been taken
from 2 Peter, and not well extracted either, he put it lower
than the supposed original. The Reformer, as also his
successors, made a distinction between the books of the
New Testament similar to that of the Old; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generally
received</span></em> (homologoumena) and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">controverted</span></em> books (antilegomena);
but the Calvinists afterwards obliterated it, as
the Roman Catholics at the Council of Trent did with the
old Testament.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> The epistle to the Hebrews, those of Jude
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and James, with the Apocalypse, belong to the latter class.
The distinction in question proceeded from genuine critical
tact on the part of the early Lutheran Church which had
canonical and deutero-canonical writings even in the New
Testament collection. Nor did the Reformers consider it a
dangerous thing to bring the fact before the people. To
make it palpable, Luther attached continuous numbers to
the first twenty-three books of his version, bringing the
four antilegomena after these, without numbers; and this
mode of marking the difference continued till the middle of
the 17th century.<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a> Luther was right in assigning a greater
or less value to the separate writings of the New Testament,
and in leaving every one to do the same. He relied on
their internal value more than tradition; taking the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word
of God</span></em> in a deeper and wider sense than its coincidence
with the Bible.

Bodenstein of Carlstad examined the question of canonicity
more thoroughly than any of his contemporaries, and
followed out the principle of private judgment in regard to
it. He divides the biblical books into three classes—1.
Books of the highest dignity, viz., the Pentateuch and
the Gospels; 2. Books of the second dignity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the works
termed prophetic by the Jews, and the fifteen epistles
universally received; 3. Books of the third and lowest authority,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Jewish Hagiographa and the seven Antilegomena
epistles of the New Testament. Among the
Apocrypha he makes two classes—such as are out of the
canon to the Hebrews yet hagiographical (Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus,
Judith, Tobit, the two Maccabees), and those that
are clearly apocryphal and to be rejected (third and fourth
Esdras, Baruch, Prayer of Manasseh, a good part of the third
chapter of Daniel, and the last two chapters of Daniel.)<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. The arrangement of the various parts comprising the
New Testament was fluctuating in the second century;
less so in the third. In the fourth century the order which
the books had commonly assumed in Greek MSS. and
writers was; the Gospels, the Acts, the Catholic Epistles,
the Pauline, and the Apocalypse. This sequence appears
in the Vatican, Sinaitic, Alexandrian and Ephrem (C)
MSS.; Cyril of Jerusalem, in the 60th Canon of the Laodicean
Council, Athanasius, Leontius of Byzantium, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. Another order prevailed in the Latin Church, viz.,
the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles of Paul, the Catholic
Epistles, and the Apocalypse. This appears in Melito,

VI. With respect to the order of the individual epistles,
the current one has been thought as old as Tertullian and
Clement of Alexandria. But the proof of this is precarious.
It appears in the fourth century, and may have been prior
to that. It is in Epiphanius, who supposes that the arrangement
was the apostle's own. Not only was it the
prevalent one in the Greek Church, but also in the Latin
as we see from the codex Amiatinus, and the Vulgate MSS.
generally. It rests upon the extent of the epistles and the
relative importance of the localities in which the believers
addressed resided.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>)
In relation to the Old Testament, the prevailing tendency
in the Greek Church was to follow the Palestinian
canon. Different lists appeared from time to time in which
the endeavor there to exclude apocryphal, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, spurious
works, was apparent. In addition to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em>, a class
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiastical</span></em> books was judged fit for reading in the
Church,—a class intermediate between the canonical and
apocryphal. The distinction between the canonical and
ecclesiastical writings appears in Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius,
Epiphanius, &amp;c. The Latin Church showed a
disposition to elevate the ecclesiastical books of the Greek
Church to the rank of the canonical, making the line between
the two indistinct; as we see from the acts of the
councils at Hippo and Carthage, in the end of the fourth
and beginning of the fifth century, where Augustine's, influence
was predominant. But notwithstanding this deviation
from the stricter method of the Greeks, learned men
like Jerome adhered to the Palestinian canon, and even
styled the ecclesiastical books <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apocryphal</span></em>, transferring the
epithet from one class to another. Hilary and Rufinus also
followed the Greek usage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the sixth and following centuries, it cannot be
said that the canon of the Greek Church was definitely
closed, notwithstanding the decrees of councils and references
to older authorities. Opinions still varied about
certain books, such as Esther; though the Palestinian list
was commonly followed. During the same period, the enlarged
canon of the Alexandrian Jews, which went far to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abolish the distinction between the canonical and deutero-canonical
books, prevailed in the West, at least in practice;
though some followed the shorter one, sanctioned as it had
been by Jerome. As both lists existed, no complete or
final settlement of the question was reached in the Latin
Church. Neither in the East nor in the West was the canon
of the Old Testament really closed; for though the stricter
principle of separation prevailed in theory, it was not
carried out in practice consistently or universally. The
two men most influential about the canon were Jerome and
Augustine; the one representing its Palestinian, the other
its Alexandrian type. After them no legal or commanding
voice fixed either, to the absolute exclusion of its rival.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) The charge of Constantine to Eusebius to make out
a list of writings for the use of the Church and its performance
may be considered as that which first put the subject
on a broad and permanent basis. Its consequences were
important. If it cannot be called the completion or close
of the New Testament canon, it determined it largely.
Eusebius made a Greek Bible containing the usual books,
except the Revelation. Though the historian of the church
was not well fitted for the task, being deficient in critical
ability and trammeled by tradition, he doubtless used his
best judgment. Hence, about the year 337, the Constantinian
Church received a Bible which had an influential origin.
No binding authority indeed attached to the list of the
Christian books it presented; but it had weight in the Greek
Church. It did not prevent different opinions, nor deter
individuals from dissent. Thus Athanasius, who disliked
Eusebius and his party, issued a list of the sacred writings
which included the Revelation. The canon of the Laodicean
Council (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 363) agreed with the Constantine one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That variations still existed in the Eastern Church is
shown by the lists which vied with one another in precedence.
The apostolic canons adopted the seven general
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
epistles, while the apostolic constitutions excluded them.
The Alexandrian MS. added to the ordinary books of the
New Testament, Clement's two epistles; and Cosmas Indicopleustes
omitted the general epistles as well as the Apocalypse.
At length the Council of Constantinople, usually
called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trullan</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 692), laid down positions that fixed
the canon for the Greek Church. The endeavor in it was
to attain to a conclusion which should unite East and West.
This council did not enumerate the separate books, but referred
to older authorities, to the eighty-five canons of the
apostles, the decrees of the synods of Laodicea, Ephesus,
Carthage, and others; to Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus,
Amphliochius of Iconium, Cyril of Alexandria, Gennadius,
&amp;c. After the fourth century there was a general desire to
fall back on apostolic times, to appeal to the Church, to ascertain
the opinion of synods or assemblies; in a word, to
rely on authority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Less discrepancy and activity were manifested about the
canon in the Western Church. Here the chief doubts were
directed to the epistle to the Hebrews and the seven general
ones. The former was early excluded, and continued to be
so even in the time of Jerome. The latter were adopted
much sooner. The impulse given by Constantine to determine
the books of Scripture re-acted on the West, where
the Church considered it its own privilege. Augustine's
influence contributed much to the settlement of the question.
The synods of Hippo (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 393) and of Carthage
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 397) received the epistle to the Hebrews and the
seven general ones, thus fixing the New Testament canon
as it now is. In 419 the African bishops, in the presence
of a Papal delegate, repeated their former decision. After
the West Goths joined the Catholic Church in the sixth
century, the Romish and Spanish Churches gave prominence
to the fact of accepting both the Apocalypse and the epistle
to the Hebrews. The canon of the West was now virtually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
closed; the fourth Council of Toledo (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 632) at which
Isidore was present, agreeing with the Augustinian list,
ratified as that list had been by Innocent the First. The
reception of the epistle to the Hebrews was facilitated by the
objections of the Arians and Semiarians; while opposition
to the Priscillianists in Spain strengthened adherence to the
traditional canon. Augustine and the Trullan Council fixed
the number of the New Testament books as they are now.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the Bible canon in general, we see that
councils had weight when they enumerated the sacred
books; that prominent teachers delivered their opinion on
the subject with effect, and that tradition contributed to one
result; but no general council closed the canon once for all,
till that of Trent promulgated its decrees. This body, however,
could only settle the subject for Romanists, since,
while the right of private judgment is exercised, no corporation
can declare some books inspired and others not,
some authoritative in matters of faith, others not, without
presumption. Though the present Bible canon rests upon
the judgment of good and learned men of different times, it
can never be finally or infallibly settled, because the critical
powers of readers differ, and all do not accept church
authority with unhesitating assent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the way of men to defer unduly to the opinions expressed
by synods and councils, especially if they be propounded
dogmatically; to acquiesce in their decisions with
facility rather than institute independent inquiry. This is
exemplified in the history of the canon, where the fallibility
of such bodies in determining canonicity is conspicuous.
It is so in the general reception of the book of Esther, while
the old poem, the Song of Songs, was called in question at
the synod of Jamnia; in the omission of the Revelation
from the canonical list by many belonging to the Greek
Church, while the epistles to Timothy and Titus were received
as St. Paul's from the beginning almost universally.

The canon of the Waldenses must have coincided at first
with that of the Roman Church; for the Dublin MS. containing

Wisdom and the first twenty-three chapters of Sirach; while
the Zurich codex of the New Testament has marginal
references to the Apocrypha; to Judith, Tobit, 4 Esdras,
Wisdom, Sirach, and Susanna. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nobla Leyczon</span></span> containing
a brief narration of the contents of the Old and New
Testaments confirms this opinion. It opposes, however,
the old law to the new, making them antagonistic. The

mythical, as appears from a comparison of it with the epistle

The articles of that <span class="tei tei-q">“Union”</span> are copied from
Morel's account of his transactions with Œcolampadius and
Bucer in 1530. The literature of this people was altered by
Hussite influences and the Reformation; so that though

The Roman Catholic canon was finally determined at the
Council of Trent (1546), which adopted all the books in the
Vulgate as sacred and canonical, without distinction. Third
and fourth Esdras, third Maccabees, and the prayer of
Manasseh were not included; though the first and last appeared
in the original Clementine edition of 1592, but apart
from the canonical books. They are not in the Sixtine
edition of 1590.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> A council at Florence in 1441 had set the
example which was followed at Trent. But this stringent
decree did not prevent individual Catholics from making a
distinction between the books, in assuming a first and second
canon or proto-canonical and deutero-canonical books; as
did Sixtis Senensis, B. Lamy, Anton a matre Dei, Jahn,
and others; though it is hardly consistent with orthodox
Catholicism or the view of those who passed the decree.
When the writings are said to be of different authority—some
more, others less—the intent of the council is violated.
The Vatican council (1870) confirmed the Tridentine
decree respecting the canon.

was the most conspicuous scholar after the
Reformation who undertook to correct the prevailing
ideas respecting the canon. Acquainted with the works of
Toland and Morgan, he adopted some of their views, and
prosecuted his inquiries on their lines chiefly in relation to
the New Testament. He had no definite principles to guide
him, but judged books chiefly by their christian value and
use to the Church. Though his views are sometimes one-sided
and his essays ill-digested, he placed the subject in
new lights, and rendered a service to truth which bore
abundant fruit in after years.<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a> He dealt tradition severe
blows, and freed theology from the yoke of the letter. He
was followed by his disciple Corrodi, by G. L. Oeder, J. D.
Michaelis, Herder, Lessing, and Eichhorn,—most of whom
recommended their views by a freshness of style which
Semler did not command. The more recent works of Gesenius,
De Wette, Zunz, Ewald, Hitzig, Geiger and Herzfeld
have contributed to form a juster opinion of the true position
which the books of the Bible occupy.

track of Semler, he prosecuted his researches into primitive
Christianity with great acuteness and singular power of
combination. Though his separation of Petrine and Pauline
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
christianity is not new, he has applied it in ways which
neither Toland nor Morgan was competent to manage.
These writers perceived the difference between the leading
principle of the twelve and that of Paul, they had some far-seeing
glimpses of the origin and differences of the New
Testament writings,<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> but they propounded them in an
unsystematic way along with untenable conjectures. It was
reserved for the Tübingen professor to elaborate the hypothesis
of an Ebionite or primitive christianity in contra-distinction
from a Pauline, applying it to the origin and
constitution of christian literature; in a word, to use a
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">tendenz-kritik</span></span>
for opening up the genius of the sacred
writings as well as the stages of early christianity out of
which they arose. The head of the Tübingen school, it is
true, has carried out the antagonism between the Petrine
and Pauline christians too rigorously, and invaded the
authenticity of the sacred writings to excess; for it is hazardous
to make a theory extremely stringent to the comparative
neglect of modifying circumstances, which, though
increasing the difficulty of criticism, contribute to the
security of its processes. Yet he has properly emphasized
internal evidence; and many of his conclusions about the
books will stand. He has thrown much light on the original
relations of parties immediately after the origin of
Christianity, and disturbed an organic unity of the New
Testament which had been merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span></em> by traditionalists.
The best Introductions to the New Testament must accept
them to some extent. The chief characteristic of the school
is the application of historic criticism to the genesis of the
New Testament writings, irrespective of tradition—a striving
to discover the circumstances or tendencies out of which
the books originated. Baur's
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">tendenz</span></span>-principle judiciously
applied cannot but produce good results.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have seen that sound critical considerations did not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regulate the formation of the three collections which made
up the entire canon of the Old Testament. Had it been so,
the Pentateuch would not have been attributed to Moses.
Neither would a number of latter prophecies have been accepted
as Isaiah's and incorporated with the prophet's
authentic productions. All the Proverbs, the book of Ecclesiastes,
and the Song of Songs would not have been
assigned to Solomon; Jonah would have been separated
from the prophets, and Daniel must have had a later position
in the Hagiographa. We cannot, therefore, credit the
collectors or editors of the books with great critical sagacity.
But they did their best in the circumstances, preserving invaluable
records of the Hebrew people. In like manner, it
has appeared, that the ecclesiastics to whom we owe the
New Testament collection were not sharp-sighted in the
literature with which they had to do. It is true that well-founded
doubts were entertained by the early Christians
about several portions, such as the second Epistle of Peter,
the Epistle to the Hebrews, &amp;c., but the Revelation was
needlessly discredited. They accepted without hesitation
the pastoral epistles as Pauline, but doubted some of the
Catholic Epistles, which bear the impress of authenticity
more strongly, such as James. It is therefore incorrect to
say that 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, James, Jude, Epistle to the
Hebrews, and the Apocalypse <span class="tei tei-q">“have been received into the
canon on evidence less complete”</span> than that belonging to
the others. The very general admission of the fourth gospel
as the apostle John's, is a curious example of facile
traditionalism. Biblical criticism, however, scarcely existed
in the first three centuries. It is for us to set the subject in
another light, because our means of judging are superior.
If the resources of the early fathers were inadequate to
the proper sifting of a copious literature, they should be
mildly judged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question of the canon is not settled. It is probably
the work of successive inquirers to set it on a right basis,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and adjust the various parts in a manner consistent with
historic criticism, sound reason, and religion. The absolute
and relative worth of books; the degrees in which they
regulate ethics and conduct; their varying values at the
times of their first appearance and our own; their places in
the general history of human progress—all these must be
determined before the documents of Judaism and Christianity
be classified aright. Their present arrangement is
external. Based on no interior principle, it furnishes little
help toward a thorough investigation of the whole. Those
who look upon the question as historical and literary take
a one-sided view. It has a theological character also. It
needs the application, not only of historic criticism, but the
immediate consciousness belonging to every Christian. The
two Testaments should be separated, and their respective
positions assigned to each—the Old having been preparatory
to the New. Should it be said bluntly, as it is in the 7th
Article of the Anglican Church, that the Old is not contrary
to the New Testament? Luther at least expressed his
opinion of the difference between them pretty clearly;<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a>
though the theologians of Germany after him evinced a desire
to minimise the difference.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> Should the general
opinion of the Protestant Church that the authority of the Old
Testament is not subordinate to that of the New, be rigidly
upheld? According to one aspect of the former it may be
so, viz., its prophetic and theological aspect, that in which
it is brought into close union with the latter; the essence
of the one being foreshadowed or implied in the other, as
Justin Martyr supposed. And this view has never lost
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supporters, who by the help of double senses, types, and
symbols, with assumed prediction of the definite and distant
future, transform the old dispensation into an outline picture
of the new; taking into it a body of divinity which is alien
from its nature. According to another aspect, viz., the
moral and historical, the equality can scarcely be allowed.
Schleiermacher is right in saying that the Old Testament
seems to be nothing but a superfluous authority for doctrine;
an opinion coinciding with that of the early Socinians, who
held that it has a historical, not a dogmatic, value. Only
such of our pious emotions as are of a general nature are
accurately reflected in the Old Testament; and all that is
most decidedly Jewish is of least value to christians. The
alleged coincidence of the Old Testament with the New
must be modified by the doctrine of development. It has
been fostered by types and prophecies supposed to refer to
christian times; by the assumed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dictation</span></em> of all Scripture by
the Holy Spirit; by fancied references of the one dispensation
to the other; by the confounding of a Jewish Messiah
sketched in various prophets, with Jesus Christ, as if the
latter had not changed, exalted and purified the Messianic
idea to suit his sublime purposes of human regeneration.
The times and circumstances in which the Old Testament
Scriptures appeared, the manners, usages, civilization, intellectual
and moral stage of the Semitic race combine to
give them a lower position than that of the New Testament
books which arose out of a more developed perception
of the relations between God and men. Spiritual apprehension
had got beyond Jewish particularism, especially
in the case of the apostle Paul, who gave the new religion
a distinct vitality by severing it from its Jewish
predecessor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The agreement of the New Testament books with themselves
must be modified by the same doctrine of development.
Jewish and Pauline christianity appear in different works,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessarily imparting a difference of views and expression;
or they are blended in various degrees, as in the epistles to
the Hebrews and the first of Peter. Hence, absolute harmony
cannot be looked for. If the standpoints of the writers
were so diverse, how can their productions coincide? The
alleged coincidence can only be intersected with varieties
proportioned to the measures in which the authors possessed
the Spirit of God. These varieties affect the matter as well
as the manner of the writings. It is therefore unphilosophical
to treat the Bible as a whole which was dictated
by the Spirit and directed to one end. Its uniformity is
chequered with variety; its harmony with disagreement.
It is a bundle of books; a selection from a wider literature,
reflecting many diversities of religious apprehension. After
the two Testaments have been rightly estimated according
to their respective merits, the contents of each should be
duly apportioned—internal evidence being the test of their
relative importance, irrespective of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> assumptions.
Their traditional origin and authority must be subordinated
to the inherent value they bear, or the conformity of the
ideas to the will of God. The gradual formation of both
canons suggests an analysis of the classes into which they
came to be put; for the same canonical dignity was not attributed
by the Jews to the books contained in the three
divisions; and the controverted writings of the New Testament
found gradual recognition very slowly. Luther made
important distinctions between the canonical books;<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> and
Carlstadt put the Antilegomena of the New Testament on
a par with the Hagiographa of the Old.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Old Testament the three classes or canons have
been generally estimated by the Jews according to their respective
antiquity; though the sacrificial worship enjoined
in the Pentateuch never formed an essential part of the
Jewish religion; the best prophets having set small value
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon it. The pure monotheistic doctrine of these last writers,
chiefly contained in the second canon, lifts that class up
to the highest rank; yet the Decalogue in the Pentateuch
is sufficient to stamp the first canon with great worth. It
must be confessed, however, that the Mosaic law was meagre,
in the domain of pure ethics; and that it promoted
among the people a slavish spirit of positivism by laying
more stress on acts than dispositions, and insisting on small
regulations. For this reason, the prophets combated its
narrow externality. The three canons were regarded with
a degree of veneration corresponding to the order in which
they stand. To apportion their respective values to the
individual parts of them is a difficult task.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the New Testament writings, we think that some
of them might conveniently occupy the position of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deutero-canonical</span></em>,
equivalent to those of the Old Testament having
that title. We allude to 2 and 3 John, Jude, James, 2 Peter,
the Revelation. It is true that a few of these were prior in
time to some of the universally-received gospels or epistles;
but time is not an important factor in a good classification.
Among the Pauline epistles themselves, classification might
be adopted; for the pastoral letters are undoubtedly post-Pauline,
and inferior to the authentic ones. In classifying
the New Testament writings, three things might be considered—the
reception they met with from the first, their
authenticity, above all, their internal excellence. The
subject is not easy, because critics are not universally
agreed about the proper rank and authenticity of a few
documents. The Epistle to the Colossians, for example,
creates perplexity; that to the Ephesians is less embarrassing,
its post-Pauline origin being tolerably clear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is wanted is a rational historic criticism to moderate
the theological hypothesis with which the older Protestants
set out, the supernatural inspiration of the books, their internal
inseparability, and their direct reference to the work
of salvation. It must be allowed that many points are independent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of dogmatics; and that the right decision in things
historical may be reached apart from any ecclesiastical
standpoint.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, should the distinction between the apocryphal and
canonical books of the Old Testament be emphasized as it
is by many? Should a sharp line be put between the two,
as though the one class, with the period it belonged to, were
characterized by the errors and anachronisms of its history;
the other by simplicity and accuracy; the one, by books
written under fictitious names; the other, by the power to
distinguish truth from falsehood or by honesty of purpose?
Should the one be a sign of the want of truthfulness and
discernment; the other, of religious simplicity? Can this
aggregation of the Apocrypha over against the Hagiographa,
serve the purpose of a just estimate? Hardly so; for
some of the latter, such as Esther and Ecclesiastes, cannot
be put above Wisdom, 1st Maccabees, Judith, Baruch, or
Ecclesiasticus. The doctrine of immortality, clearly expressed
in the Book of Wisdom, is not in Ecclesiastes;
neither is God once named in the Book of Esther as author
of the marvelous deliverances which the chosen people are
said to have experienced. The history narrated in 1st
Maccabees is more credible than that in Esther. It is therefore
misleading to mark off all the apocryphal works as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em> and all the canonical ones as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em>. The divine and
the human elements in man are too intimately blended to
admit of such separation. The best which he produces
partakes of both. The human element still permeates them
as long as God speaks through man; and He neither dictates
nor speaks otherwise. In the attributes claimed for
the canonical books no rigid line can be drawn. It may be
that the inspiration of their authors differed in degree; that
the writer of Ecclesiastes, for example, was more philosophical
than Jesus, son of Sirach; but different degrees of
inspiration belong to the canonical writers themselves.
Undue exaltation of the Hebrew canon does injustice to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wider Alexandrian one. Yet some still speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“the pure
Hebrew canon,”</span> identifying it with that of the Church of
England. We admit that history had become legendary,
that it was written in an oratorical style by the Alexandrian
Jews, and was used for didactic purposes as in Tobit and
Judith. Gnomic poetry had survived in the book of Sirach;
prophecy, in Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah, though
here the language is already prosaic. Imitation is too observable
in the matter and manner of the Apocrypha. They
have parallels, however, among the Hagiographa, which
originated in an age when the genuine breath of prophetic
inspiration had ceased; when history and prophecy had
degenerated; so that the transition from Esther and Malachi
to Judith and Baruch, as also from Proverbs to Wisdom, is
not great.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmudic</span></em> canon is generally adopted at the present
day. It was not, however, universally received even by
the Jews; for Esther was omitted out of it by those from
whom Melito got his catalogue in Palestine; while Sirach
was annexed to it as late as the beginning of the 4th century.
Baruch was also added in several Jewish circles,
doubtless on account of its supposed authorship. Thus
<span class="tei tei-q">“the pure Hebrew canon”</span> was not one and the same among
all Jews; and therefore the phrase is misleading. Neither
is it correct to say that it is the only canon distinctly recognized
during the first four centuries, unless the usage of
the early fathers be set over against their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span></em> contrary
judgment; nor can all who followed the Alexandrian canon
be pronounced uncritical, including Origen himself. A
stereotyped canon of the Old Testament, either among Jews
or Christians of the first four centuries, which excluded all
the apocryphal books and included all the canonical ones,
cannot be shown. And in regard to <span class="tei tei-q">“the critical judgment”</span>
of Jews and Christians in that period it is arbitrary
to suppose that such as adopted the present canonical
books alone were more discerning than others. They were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more traditional and conservative; their discriminating
faculty not corresponding to the degree of their reliance
on the past.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The aim of the inquirer should be to find from competent
witnesses—from contemporaneous or succeeding writers of
trustworthy character—the authors and ages of the biblical
books. When evidence of this kind is not available as
often happens, the only resource is the internal. The external
evidence in favor of the canon is all but exhausted,
and nothing of importance can be added to it now. Its
strength has been brought out; its weakness has not been
equally exhibited. The problem resolves itself into an examination
of internal characteristics, which may be strong
enough to modify or counterbalance the external. The
latter have had an artificial preponderance in the past;
henceforward they must be regulated by the internal. The
main conclusion should be drawn from the contents of the
books themselves. And the example of Jews and Christians,
to whom we owe the Bible canon, shows that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">classification</span></em>
is necessary. This is admitted both by Roman
Catholic writers and orthodox Protestants. A gloss-writer
on what is usually called the <span class="tei tei-q">“decree of Gratian,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the
Bolognese canonist of the 12th century, remarks about the
canonical books, <span class="tei tei-q">“all may be received but may not be held
in the same estimation.”</span> John Gerhard speaks of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second
order</span></em>, containing the books of the New Testament, about whose authors there
were some doubts in the Church;<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> and
Quenstedt similarly specifies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proto-canonical</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deutero-canonical</span></em>
New Testament books, or those of the first and
second order.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> What are degrees or kinds of inspiration
assumed by many, but a tacit acknowledgment of the fact
that books vary in intrinsic value as they are more or less
impregnated with divine truth or differ in the proportion of
the eternal and temporal elements which commingle in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every revealed religion? Doubtless the authors from whom
the separate books proceeded, if discoverable, should be regarded;
the inspiration of an Isaiah is higher than that of
a Malachi, and an apostle is more authoritative than an
evangelist; but the authors are often unknown. Besides,
the process of redaction through which many of the writings
passed, hinders an exact knowledge of authorship.
In these circumstances the books themselves must determine
the position they should occupy in the estimation of those
who are looking at records of the past to help their spiritual
life. And if it be asked, What principle should lie at the
basis of a thorough classification? the answer is, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">normative
element</span></em> contained in the sacred books. This is the
characteristic which should regulate classification. The
time when a book appeared, its author, the surrounding
circumstances that influenced him, are of less consequence
than its bearing upon the spiritual education of mankind.
The extent of its adequacy to promote this end determines
the rank. Such books as embody the indestructible essence
of religion with the fewest accidents of time, place and
nature—which present conditions not easily disengaged
from the imperishable life of the soul, deserve the first
rank. Whatever Scriptures express ideas consonant with
the nature of God as a holy, loving, just and good Being—as
a benevolent Father not willing the destruction of any
of his children; the Scriptures presenting ideas of Him
consistent with pure reason and man's highest instincts,
besides such as set forth our sense of dependence on the
infinite; the books, in short, that contain a revelation from
God with least admixture of the human conditions under
which it is transmitted—these belong to the highest class.
If they lead the reader away from opinion to practice,
from dogma to life, from non-doing to obedience to the
law of moral duty, from the notion that everything in salvation
has been done for him to the keeping of the commandments,
from particularist conceptions about the divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mercy to the widest belief of its overshadowing presence—such
books of Scripture are in that same proportion to be
ranked among the best. In regard to the Old Testament,
conformity to Christ's teaching will determine rank; or,
which is tantamount, conformity to that pure reason which
is God's natural revelation in man; a criterion which assigns
various ranks to such Scriptures as appeared among
a Semite race at a certain stage of its development. In the
New Testament, the words and precepts of Jesus have a
character of their own, though it is very difficult to select
them from the gospels. The supposition that the apostles'
productions possess a higher authority than those of their
disciples, is natural. But the immediate followers of
Christ did not all stand on one platform. Differing from
one another even in important principles, it is possible, if
not certain, that some of their disciples' composition may
be of higher value. The spirit of God may have wrought
within the apostles generally with greater power and
clearness than in other teachers; but its operation is conditioned
not merely by outward factors but by individual
idiosyncrasy; so that one who had not seen the Lord and
was therefore not an apostle proper, may have apprehended
his mind better than an immediate disciple. Paul stood
above the primitive apostles in the extent to which he
fathomed the pregnant sayings of Jesus and developed
their latent germs. Thus the normative element—that
which determines the varying degrees of authority belonging
to the New Testament—does not lie in apostolic authorship
but internal worth; in the clearness and power
with which the divine Spirit enabled men to grasp the
truth. By distinguishing the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em>
in christianity, the writings necessarily rise or sink in
proportion to these elements. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em> is the essence
and gem of revealed truth. Perfectibility belongs only
to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal</span></em>; it cannot be predicated of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em>.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bible is not pervaded by unity of purpose or plan, so as to
make a good classification easy. Least of all is it dominated
by such substantial unity as has been connected with
one man; for the conception of a Messiah was never the
national belief of Judaism, but a notion projected by
prophets into the future to comfort the people in times of
disaster; the forecasting of aspirations doomed to disappointment.
From the collection presenting various degrees
of intellectual and moral development, it is difficult to see
a sufficient reason for some being canonized to the exclusion

How far do they extend? How much of the first

As to the Old Testament, the Palestinian Jews determined
the canonical books by gradually contracting the list and
stopping it at a time when their calamities throwing them
back on the past for springs of hope, had stiffened them
within a narrow traditionalism; but their brethren in Egypt,
touched by Alexandrian culture and Greek philosophy,
received later productions into their canon, some of which
at least are of equal value with Palestinian ones. In any
case, the degree of authority attaching to the Biblical
books grew from less to greater, till it culminated in a
divine character, a sacredness rising even to infallibility.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Doubtless the Jews of Palestine distinguished the canonical
from the apocryphal or deutero-canonical books on grounds
satisfactory to themselves; but their judgment was not infallible.
A senate of Rabbis under the old dispensation
might err, as easily as a synod of priests under the new.
Though they may have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generally</span></em> correct, it must not
be assumed that they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> so. Their discernment
may be commended without being magnified. The general
feeling of leaning upon the past was a sound one, for the
best times of Judaism had departed, and with them the
most original effusions; yet the wave of Platonism that
passed over Alexandria could not but quicken even the
conservative mind of the Jew. Greek thought blended
with echoes of the past, though in dulled form. Still a
line had to be drawn in the national literature; and it was
well drawn on the whole. The feeling existed that the
collection must be closed with works of a certain period
and a certain character; and it was closed accordingly,
without preventing individuals from putting their private
opinions over against authority, and dissenting.

At the present day a new arrangement is necessary; but
where is the ecclesiastical body bold enough to undertake
it? And if it were attempted or carried out by non-ecclesiastical
parties, would the churches approve or adopt
the proceeding? We venture to say, that if some books be
separated from the collection and others put in their place—if
the classification of some be altered, and their authority
raised or lowered—good will be done; the Bible will
have a fairer degree of normal power in doctrine and
morals, and continue to promote spiritual life. Faith in
Christ precedes faith in books. Unless criticism be needlessly
negative it cannot remove this time-honored legacy
from the position it is entitled to, else the spiritual consciousness
of humanity will rebel. While the subject is
treated reverently, and the love of truth overrides dogmatic
prejudices, the canon will come forth in a different form
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from that which it has had for centuries—a form on which

The canon was a work of divine providence, because
history, in a religious view, necessarily implies the fact.
It was a work of inspiration, because the agency of the
Holy Spirit has always been with the people of God as a
principle influencing their life. It was not, however, the
result of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar</span></em> act of divine inspiration at any
one time, but of a gradual illuminating process, shaped by
influences more or less active in the divine economy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The canonical authority of Scripture does not depend on
any church or council. The early church may be cited as
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">witness</span></em> for it; that is all. Canonical authority lies in
Scripture itself, and is inherent in the books so far as they
contain a declaration of the divine will. Hence, there is
truth in the statement of old theologians that the authority
of Scripture is from God alone. It was the early church
indeed that made the canon, selecting the books which appeared
to have been written by apostles or apostolic men,
and carrying over to them authority from alleged authenticity
more than internal value. But the latter is the real
index of authority; and God is the fountain from whom
spiritual endowments proceed.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a>
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonicity</span></em> of the books
is a distinct question from that of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authenticity</span></em>. The
latter is a thing of historic criticism; the former of doctrinal
belief. Their ecclesiastical authority rests on outward
attestation; their normal, on faith and feeling.

tradition, which attributes the redaction of the book to
the men of the great synagogue who are said to have acted under the
influence of the divine spirit, separates the three apocryphal pieces
from the rest; but this arose from the desire of discountenancing the
idea that the work consists of romance and legend. Such later tradition
took curious ways of justifying the canonicity of Daniel and the
redaction of it by the great synagogue, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex gr.</span></span>, the assumption that
the second part arose out of a series of unconnected
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">Megiloth</span></span> which
were not reduced to chronological order. Still the Midrash maintains
that Daniel, or the person writing in his name, was no prophet, like
Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, but a man of visions, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apocalyptist</span></em>.
It was a general belief, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visions</span></em> had come into the place of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophecy</span></em> when the book appeared. The Greek translation could not have
been long after the original, because it is used in the First Book of
Maccabees. The interval between the Hebrew and the Greek was inconsiderable.
The translator not only departed from, but added to,
the original, inserting such important pieces as the Prayer of Azarias,
the Song of the Three Children, the history of Susanna, and that of
Bel and the Dragon. Whether any of these had been written before
is uncertain. Most of the traditions they embody were probably reduced
to writing by the translator, and presented in his peculiar style.
The assertion, that Josephus was unacquainted with these additions is
hazardous, since the way in which he speaks of Daniel's fame (Antiq.
x. 11, 7), and especially of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the books</span></em> he wrote (τὰ βιβλία), supposes
some relation to them. Elsewhere he speaks of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one book</span></em> (x. 10, 4;
xi. 8, 5), where he may have thought of the canonical part.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_52" name="note_52" href="#noteref_52">52.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">פתוביס,

The apostle's argument rests on the occurrence of the singular
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seed</span></em>, σπέρμα) in Genesis xvii. 8 (LXX.), not the plural
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seeds</span></em>, σπέρματα);
though the plural of the corresponding Hebrew word could not have
been used, because it has a different signification. Grammatical inaccuracy
is made the basis of a certain theological interpretation. Those
who wish to see a specimen of labored ingenuity unsuccessfully applied
to the justification of St. Paul's argument in this passage, may
consult Tholuck's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Das alte Testament
in neuem Testament</span></span>, p. 63, etc.

body of literature originating in the fragment of Papias
preserved by Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. iii, 39, 1-4) has appeared;
though it is difficult to obtain satisfactory conclusions. Not only have
Weiffenbach and Leimbach written treatises on the subject, but other
scholars have entered into it more or less fully,—Zahn, Steitz, Riggenbach,
Hilgenfeld, Lipsius, Keim, Martens, Loman, Holtzmann, Hausrath,
Tietz, and Lightfoot. The fragment is not of great weight in
settling the authenticity of the four gospels. Indirectly indeed it
throws some light on the connection of two evangelists with written
memoirs of the life of Jesus; but it rather suggests than solves various
matters of importance. It is tolerably clear that the gospels, if such
they may be called, of which he speaks as written by Matthew and
Mark, were not identical with the works now existing under the names
of these evangelists; and that no safe conclusion can be drawn from
Papias's silence about John's and Luke's as not then in existence.
Neither the present gospels nor any other had been converted into
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>; since he regarded oral traditions as more credible than
written memoirs. Those who hold that the presbyter John was none
other than the apostle, Eusebius having misunderstood the fragment
and made a different John from the apostle, as well as the critics who
deduce from the fragment the fact that John suffered martyrdom in
Palestine, have not established these conclusions. Papias refers to
the material he got for explaining the λογία, rather than the source
whence they were drawn. But whether he learnt directly from the
elders, or indirectly as the preposition (παρὰ) would seem to indicate,
and whether the sentence beginning with <span class="tei tei-q">“What Andrew,”</span> &amp;c., (τί
Ἀνδρέας κ. τ. λ.) stands in apposition to the <span class="tei tei-q">“words of the elders,”</span>
